The activation of activator protein-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB induced by UVB was dose-dependently inhibited by myricetin treatment. Western blot and kinase assay data revealed that myricetin inhibited Fyn kinase activity and subsequently attenuated UVB-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Pull-down assays revealed that myricetin competitively bound with ATP to suppress Fyn kinase activity. Importantly, myricetin exerted similar inhibitory effects compared with 4-amino-5-(4-chloro-phenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, a well-known pharmacologic inhibitor of Fyn. In vivo mouse skin data also revealed that myricetin inhibited Fyn kinase activity directly and subsequently attenuated UVB-induced COX-2 expression. Mouse skin tumorigenesis data clearly showed that pretreatment with myricetin significantly suppressed UVB-induced skin tumor incidence in a dose-dependent manner. Docking data suggest that myricetin is easily docked to the ATP-binding site of Fyn, which is located between the N and C lobes of the kinase domain. Overall, these results indicated that myricetin exerts potent chemopreventive activity mainly by targeting Fyn in skin carcinogenesis."

Rotenone caused a time- and dose-dependent decrease in cell viability and the degree of LDH release was proportionally to the effects on cell viability. Cells were pretreated with fraxetin, myricetin and N-acetylcysteine at different concentrations for 30 min before exposure to rotenone. Cytotoxicity of rotenone (5 uM) for 16 hr was significantly diminished as well as the release of LDH into the medium, by the effect of fraxetin, myricetin and N-acetylcysteine, with fraxetin (100 uM) and N-acetylcysteine (100 uM) being more effective than myricetin (50 uM)..."
9,quercetin,5281672,0.995,"The effects of myricetin on either MRP1 or MRP2 mediated vincristine resistance in transfected MDCKII cells were examined. The results obtained show that myricetin can inhibit both MRP1 and MRP2 mediated vincristine efflux in a concentration dependent manner. The IC50 values for cellular vincristine transport inhibition by myricetin were 30.5+/-1.7 uM for MRP1 and 24.6+/-1.3 uM for MRP2 containing MDCKII cells. Cell proliferation analysis showed that the MDCKII control cells are very sensitive towards vincristine toxicity with an IC50 value of 1.1+/-0.1 uM. The MDCKII MRP1 and MRP2 cells are less sensitive towards vincristine toxicity with IC50 values of 33.1+/-1.9 and 22.2+/-1.4 uM, respectively. In both the MRP1 and MRP2 cells, exposure to 25 uM myricetin enhances the sensitivity of the cells towards vincristine toxicity to IC50 values of 7.6+/-0.5 and 5.8+/-0.5 uM, respectively.

10,quercetin,5280863,0.989,"It has been reported that tamoxifen is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, and kaempferol is an inhibitor of P-gp and CYP3A. Hence, it could be expected that kaempferol would affect the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen. Thus, tamoxifen was administered orally (10 mg/kg) without or with oral kaempferol (2.5 and 10 mg/kg). In the presence of kaempferol, the total area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time infinity (AUC) of tamoxifen was significantly greater, C(max) was significantly higher and F was considerably greater than those without kaempferol. The enhanced bioavailability of oral tamoxifen by oral kaempferol could have been due to an inhibition of CYP3A and P-gp by kaempferol. The presence of kaempferol did not alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of a metabolite of tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen. This could have been because the contribution of CYP3A to the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen is not considerable in rats."
11,quercetin,5280863,0.989,"This study was to investigate the effect of kaempferol on the pharmacokinetics of etoposide after oral or intravenous administration of etoposide in rats. The oral (6 mg/kg) or intravenous (2 mg/kg) etoposide was administered to rats alone or 30 min after the oral kaempferol (1, 4, or 12 mg/kg) administration. Compared to the oral control group, the presence of kaempferol significantly (4 mg/kg, P < 0.05; 12 mg/kg, P < 0.01) increased the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) and the peak concentration (C(max)) of the oral etoposide. Kaempferol decreased significantly (4 or 12 mg/kg, P < 0.05) the total body clearance (CL/F) of oral etoposide, while there was no significant change in the terminal halflife (t(1/2)), the elimination rate constant (K(el)) and the time to reach the peak concentration (T(max)) of etoposide in the presense of kaempferol. Consequently, the absolute bioavailability (AB%) of oral etoposide with kaempferol was significantly higher (4 mg/kg, P < 0.05; 12 mg/kg, P < 0.01) than those from the control group. Compared to the intravenous control group, the presence of kaempferol enhanced the AUC of intravenously administered etoposide, however, only presence of 12 mg/kg of kaempferol significant (P < 0.05) increased AUC of etoposide. The enhanced bioavailability of oral etoposide by kaempferol could have been due to an inhibition of cytochrom P450 (CYP) 3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the intestinal or decreased total body clearance in the liver by kaempferol. The dosage regimen of etoposide should be taken into consideration for potential drug interaction when combined with kaempferol or dietary supplements containing kaempferol in patients."
12,quercetin,5280863,0.989,"Twenty male SD rats, weighing 220-260 g, were distributed randomly into 4 groups. The animals were fasted, but allowed free access to water for 12 hr before the administration of drugs. Nifedipine dissolved in corn oil was administered via gastric intubation to the rats in control group at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Kaempferol was administered orally to the other three groups with dose of 5, 10, 15 mg/kg, respectively, followed by oral administration of nifedipine 10 mg/kg. Blood samples were collected through tail vein in heparinized plastic microcentrifuge tubes before and after drug administration. The plasma concentration of NFP was monitored with reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Nimodipine was used as the internal standard. Statistical data evaluation was performed with Student's t-test and one-way analysis of variances. The maximal plasma concentration (C(max)) of the three treated groups were 0.51, 0.70 and 0.81 microg/ml, respectively. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-8)) were 1.81, 2.83 and 3.63 ug/(hr.mL(-1)), respectively. The C(max), AUC(0-8) and the mean retention time (MRT(0-8)) of nifedipine were significantly increased by simultaneous oral treatment with kaempferol (P<0.01). On the other hand, there were no significant differences in the mean peak value time in plasma (T(max)) and the elimination half-life (t1/2(ke)) between the control and the treated groups. The concomitant oral use of kaempferol with nifedipine may influence the pharmacokinetic parameters of nifedipine in rats, which suggests that kaempferol might reduce the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine."
13,quercetin,5280863,0.989,"Quercetin, kaempferol and biapigenin significantly reduced neuronal death caused by 100 uM kainate plus 100 uM N-methyl-D-aspartate.

14,quercetin,5280443,0.94,"... This study ... investigated the anti-genotoxic effects of apigenin against a known genotoxicant, benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) (125 mg/g orally) toxicity in Swiss albino mice. B(a)P administration led to induction of cytochrome P-450 (CYP), aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) and DNA strand breaks (P < 0.001), which was suppressed by apigenin (2.5 and 5 mg/kg orally) dose dependently (P < 0.001). B(a)P-induced depletion in the level of reduced glutathione (GSH), quinone reductase (QR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) was also shown to be restored by apigenin pre-treatment (P < 0.001). A simultaneous significant and dose-dependent reduction was noted in DNA strand breaks and in-vivo DNA damage (P < 0.001), which gives some insight into restoration of DNA integrity in modulator groups. These results strongly support the protective nature of apigenin against B(a)P-induced toxicity."
15,quercetin,5280443,0.94,"Apigenin (0.01 uM) significantly increased the growth of MC3T3-E1 cells and caused a significant elevation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and collagen content in the cells (P < 0.05). The effect of apigenin in increasing ALP activity and collagen content was completely prevented by the presence of 10-6 M cycloheximide and 10-6 M tamoxifen, suggesting that apigenin's effect results from a newly synthesized protein component and might be partly involved in estrogen action."
16,quercetin,5280443,0.94,"The effect of ... apigenin on the development of bombesin-enhanced peritoneal metastasis from intestinal adenocarcinomas induced by azoxymethane was investigated in male Wistar rats. From the start of the experiment, rats were given weekly sc injections of azoxymethane (7.4 mg/kg body weight) for 10 weeks and sc injection of bombesin (40 ug/kg body weight) every other day, and from week 16, sc injections of apigenin (0.75 or 1.5 mg/kg body weight) every other day until the end of the experiment in week 45. Bombesin significantly increased the incidence of intestinal tumors and cancer metastasis to the peritoneum in week 45. It also significantly increased the labeling index of intestinal cancers. Although administration of apigenin at either dose with bombesin had little or no effect on the enhancement of intestinal carcinogenesis by bombesin, the location, histologic type, depth of involvement, infiltrating growth patterns and labeling index, it was found to decrease significantly the incidence of cancer metastasis. Apigenin significantly decreased the incidence of lymphatic vessel invasion of adenocarcinomas, which was enhanced by bombesin. In vitro experiments revealed that apigenin inhibited bombesin-enhanced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-9 expression."

The objective of the present study was to investigate the potential of the phytoestrogen genistein to influence the reproductive developmental toxicity of the endocrine-active pesticide methoxychlor. Three levels of genistein (0, 300, or 800 ppm) and two levels of methoxychlor (0 or 800 ppm) were used in this study. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to the two compounds, either alone or in combinations, through dietary administration to dams during pregnancy and lactation and to the offspring directly after weaning. Both compounds, methoxychlor in particular, were associated with reduced body growth at 800 ppm, but pregnancy outcome was not affected by either treatment. An acceleration of vaginal opening (VO) in the exposed female offspring was the only observed effect of genistein at 300 ppm. Exposure to 800 ppm genistein or 800 ppm methoxychlor caused accelerated VO and also altered estrous cyclicity toward persistent estrus in the female offspring. The estrogenic responses to genistein and methoxychlor administered together were apparently accumulative of the effects associated with each compound alone. Methoxychlor, but not genistein, delayed preputial separation (PPS) in the male rats. When administered with methoxychlor, genistein at 800 ppm enhanced the effect of methoxychlor on delaying PPS. Genistein and methoxychlor treatment did not change gender-specific motor activity patterns in either sex. To explore possible mechanisms for interaction between the two compounds on development, we performed estrogen receptor (ER)- and androgen receptor (AR)-based in vitro transcriptional activation assays using genistein and the primary methoxychlor metabolite 2,2-bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (HPTE). While the in vitro assays supported the estrogenic effects of genistein and methoxychlor and the antiandrogenic effects of methoxychlor, the reactivity of these compounds with ERs alpha and beta could not predict the greater in vivo estrogenic potency of methoxychlor over genistein; nor could the potentiation of the methoxychlor effect on PPS by genistein be predicted based on in vitro HPTE and genistein reactions with the AR. Data from this study indicate that phytoestrogens are capable of altering the toxicological behaviors of other EACs, and the interactions of these compounds may involve complexities that are difficult to predict based on their in vitro steroid receptor reactivities.

Interactions between the soy isoflavone, genistein, and an antiestrogen, tamoxifen (TAM), on the growth of estrogen (E)-dependent breast cancer (MCF-7) cells implanted in ovariectomized athymic mice /were investigated/. ... Six treatment groups were used: control (C); 0.25 mg estradiol (E2) implant (E); E2 implant + 2.5 mg TAM implant (2.5 TE); E2 implant + 2.5 mg TAM implant + 1000 ppm genistein (2.5 TEG); E2 implant + 5 mg TAM implant (5 TE), and E2 implant +5 mg TAM implant +1000 ppm genistein (5 TEG). Treatment with TAM (2.5 TE and 5 TE) suppressed E2-stimulated MCF-7 tumor growth in ovariectomized athymic mice. Dietary genistein negated/overwhelmed the inhibitory effect of TAM on MCF-7 tumor growth, lowered E2 level in plasma, and increased expression of E-responsive genes (e.g., pS2, PR, and cyclin D1). ...

It was found that the inhibitory rate in cells with combined treatment was significantly higher than that of the cells treated with IR or genistein alone. After treatments of IR (4 Gy) combined with genistein (40 micromol/L), the apoptotic index of the cells was significantly increased and the cells were arrested in the G2/M phase. Survivin mRNA expression increased after IR (4 Gy), while it significantly decreased after combined treatment. These findings indicated that genistein enhanced the radiosensitivity of cervical cancer HeLa cells, and the mechanisms for this action might include increase of apoptosis, decrease of survivin expression, and prolongation of cell cycle arrest."

Bombesin significantly increased the incidence of intestinal tumors and cancer metastasis to the peritoneum in week 45. It also significantly increased the labeling index of intestinal cancers. Although administration of apigenin at either dose with bombesin had little or no effect on the enhancement of intestinal carcinogenesis by bombesin, the location, histologic type, depth of involvement, infiltrating growth patterns and labeling index, it was found to decrease significantly the incidence of cancer metastasis. Apigenin significantly decreased the incidence of lymphatic vessel invasion of adenocarcinomas, which was enhanced by bombesin.

On the other hand, there were no significant differences in the mean peak value time in plasma (T(max)) and the elimination half-life (t1/2(ke)) between the control and the treated groups. The concomitant oral use of kaempferol with nifedipine may influence the pharmacokinetic parameters of nifedipine in rats, which suggests that kaempferol might reduce the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine."

78,isorhamnetin,5280443,0.862,"... This study ... investigated the anti-genotoxic effects of apigenin against a known genotoxicant, benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) (125 mg/g orally) toxicity in Swiss albino mice. B(a)P administration led to induction of cytochrome P-450 (CYP), aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) and DNA strand breaks (P < 0.001), which was suppressed by apigenin (2.5 and 5 mg/kg orally) dose dependently (P < 0.001). B(a)P-induced depletion in the level of reduced glutathione (GSH), quinone reductase (QR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) was also shown to be restored by apigenin pre-treatment (P < 0.001). A simultaneous significant and dose-dependent reduction was noted in DNA strand breaks and in-vivo DNA damage (P < 0.001), which gives some insight into restoration of DNA integrity in modulator groups. These results strongly support the protective nature of apigenin against B(a)P-induced toxicity."

From the start of the experiment, rats were given weekly sc injections of azoxymethane (7.4 mg/kg body weight) for 10 weeks and sc injection of bombesin (40 ug/kg body weight) every other day, and from week 16, sc injections of apigenin (0.75 or 1.5 mg/kg body weight) every other day until the end of the experiment in week 45. Bombesin significantly increased the incidence of intestinal tumors and cancer metastasis to the peritoneum in week 45. It also significantly increased the labeling index of intestinal cancers. Although administration of apigenin at either dose with bombesin had little or no effect on the enhancement of intestinal carcinogenesis by bombesin, the location, histologic type, depth of involvement, infiltrating growth patterns and labeling index, it was found to decrease significantly the incidence of cancer metastasis. Apigenin significantly decreased the incidence of lymphatic vessel invasion of adenocarcinomas, which was enhanced by bombesin. In vitro experiments revealed that apigenin inhibited bombesin-enhanced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-9 expression."

The cytotoxic effect of this compound and its augmentative effect on the anticancer drug irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11) were investigated in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29. Asiatic acid dose-dependently showed cytotoxicity in HT-29 cells. DNA fragmentation, annexin-positive apoptotic cells, and caspase-3 activation were observed in a dose-dependent manner. A caspase-3 inhibitor suppressed the DNA ladder formation in a concentration-dependent manner. Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins were decreased by asiatic acid treatment. These results indicate that asiatic acid induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells via caspase-3 activation. Cytotoxic effects of combined treatment with CPT-11 and asiatic acid on HT-29 cells were further examined. Simultaneous treatment or sequential exposure first to asiatic acid and then to CPT-11 showed an additive effect. Synergism was observed when cells were first exposed to CPT-11 and then to asiatic acid. These results suggest that asiatic acid can be used as an agent for increasing sensitivity of colon cancer cells to treatment with CPT-11 or as an agent for reducing adverse effects of CPT-11."
88,hederagenin,119034,0.995,"Asiatic acid, a pentacyclic triterpene, has been reported to induce apoptosis of various human cancer cells. In the present study, we assessed the anti-tumor promoting effect of asiatic acid against 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA)-mediated skin tumorigenesis in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated ICR mice. Topical application of asiatic acid prior to each application of TPA resulted in a significant reduction in skin tumor formation. We also found that pre-application of asiatic acid alleviated TPA-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation, which is a conventional marker for skin tumor promotion. In addition, asiatic acid inhibited the TPA-induced generation of nitric oxide (NO) and expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which are known to play important roles in tumor growth, especially in the promotion stage. In addition, topical application of aminoguanidine (AG), a selective iNOS inhibitor, and N(G)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (NAME), another iNOS inhibitor, 30 min prior to TPA treatment significantly inhibited the TPA-induced COX-2 expression. These results suggest that asiatic acid may exert anti-tumorigenesis through inhibitory actions in NO and COX-2 signals."
89,hederagenin,119034,0.995,"Asiatic acid and corosolic acid are two natural products identified as biofilm inhibitors in a biofilm inhibition assay. We evaluated the activities of these two compounds on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms grown in rotating disk reactors (RDRs) in combination with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin. To determine the ruggedness of our systems, the antibiotic susceptibilities of these biofilms were assessed with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin. The biofilm bacteria produced in the RDR were shown to display remarkable tolerance to 10 mug/ml of ciprofloxacin, thus mimicking the tolerance observed in recalcitrant bacterial infections. These studies further demonstrate that a nonmucoid strain of P. aeruginosa can form a biofilm that tolerates ciprofloxacin at clinically relevant concentrations. Neither asiatic acid nor corosolic acid reduced the viable cell density of P. aeruginosa biofilms. However, both compounds increased the susceptibility of biofilm bacteria to subsequent treatment with tobramycin, suggesting asiatic acid and corosolic acid to be compounds that potentiate the activity of antibiotics. A similar statistical interaction was observed between ciprofloxacin and subsequent treatment with tobramycin."

Protective effects of asiatic acid (AA) and beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) were evaluated on hepatocytes injured by D-GalN (2 mmol/L) or CCl4 (10 mmol/L). Cell morphology was observed by light microscope, cell viability was measured by MTT assay, AST and LDH were determined by an automatic analyzer. Fluorescence assay was applied to test reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide end products (NOx) and reduced glutathione (GSH), and JC-1 staining was used to determine mitochondria membrane potential (DeltaPsim). AST and LDH in medium were decreased when treated with AA and GA after D-GalN injury (P<0.05), furthermore AA enhanced the hepatocyte viability (P<0.05). Moreover, AA and GA significantly reduced ROS and NOx generation, and ameliorated DeltaPsim lost induced by D-GalN. AA also inhibited GSH decrease due to D-GalN and CCl4 treatment. Both AA and GA could protect hepatocytes from D-GalN and CCl4 injuries, which is associated with reducing intracellular ROS and NOx, reversing GSH depression and ameliorating DeltaPsim lost."

Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into eight groups, receiving AOM or vehicle, and fed normal diet or pellets containing 0.11% UA in the initiation or promotion/progression phase. The formation of ACF in the colon and the activities of three types of mucosal SMase were examined. UA significantly reduced the incidence of ACF containing three or more crypts in the initiation group, but had no significant effect in the promotion/progression group. AOM reduced mucosal Alk-SMase activity, and the inhibitory effects could not be prevented by UA. However, in both AOM-treated and normal rats, UA increased the activity of colonic neutral SMase markedly and that of acid SMase activity mildly. These results indicate that UA has chemopreventive effects in the initiation phase of colon cancer associated with changes in SM metabolism."

All animals were sacrificed in week 5 for the evaluation of ACF. The results showed a significant reduction in the frequency of ACF in the group treated with the triterpenoid compounds plus DMH when compared to those treated with DMH alone, suggesting that UA and OA suppress the formation of ACF and have a protective effect against colon carcinogenesis."
95,hederagenin,64945,0.989,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the chloroform extract of Terminalia catappa L. leaves (TCCE) on carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced acute liver damage and D-galactosamine (D-GalN)-induced hepatocyte injury. Moreover, the effects of ursolic acid and asiatic acid, two isolated components of TCCE, on mitochondria and free radicals were investigated to determine the mechanism underlying the action of TCCE on hepatotoxicity. In the acute hepatic damage test, remarkable rises in the activity of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (5.7- and 2.0-fold) induced by CCl(4) were reversed and significant morphological changes were lessened with pre-treatment with 50 and 100 mg/kg TCCE. In the hepatocyte injury experiment, the increases in ALT and AST levels (1.9- and 2.1-fold) in the medium of primary cultured hepatocytes induced by D-GalN were blocked by pre-treatment with 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 g/L TCCE. In addition, Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial swelling was dose-dependently inhibited by 50-500 uM ursolic acid and asiatic acid. Both ursolic acid and asiatic acid, at concentrations ranging from 50 to 500 uM, showed dose-dependent superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. It can be concluded that TCCE has hepatoprotective activity and the mechanism is related to protection of liver mitochondria and the scavenging action on free radicals."

Three levels of genistein (0, 300, or 800 ppm) and two levels of methoxychlor (0 or 800 ppm) were used in this study. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to the two compounds, either alone or in combinations, through dietary administration to dams during pregnancy and lactation and to the offspring directly after weaning. Both compounds, methoxychlor in particular, were associated with reduced body growth at 800 ppm, but pregnancy outcome was not affected by either treatment. An acceleration of vaginal opening (VO) in the exposed female offspring was the only observed effect of genistein at 300 ppm. Exposure to 800 ppm genistein or 800 ppm methoxychlor caused accelerated VO and also altered estrous cyclicity toward persistent estrus in the female offspring. The estrogenic responses to genistein and methoxychlor administered together were apparently accumulative of the effects associated with each compound alone. Methoxychlor, but not genistein, delayed preputial separation (PPS) in the male rats. When administered with methoxychlor, genistein at 800 ppm enhanced the effect of methoxychlor on delaying PPS. Genistein and methoxychlor treatment did not change gender-specific motor activity patterns in either sex. To explore possible mechanisms for interaction between the two compounds on development, we performed estrogen receptor (ER)- and androgen receptor (AR)-based in vitro transcriptional activation assays using genistein and the primary methoxychlor metabolite 2,2-bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (HPTE). While the in vitro assays supported the estrogenic effects of genistein and methoxychlor and the antiandrogenic effects of methoxychlor, the reactivity of these compounds with ERs alpha and beta could not predict the greater in vivo estrogenic potency of methoxychlor over genistein; nor could the potentiation of the methoxychlor effect on PPS by genistein be predicted based on in vitro HPTE and genistein reactions with the AR.

129,Olitoriside,2724385,0.992,"The effects of concomitant drug therapy on the absorption, distribution, and elimination of digoxin and digitoxin are reviewed. A number of agents can increase or decrease the absorption of digoxin and digitoxin from the gastrointestinal tract by altering GI motility, binding the drugs through physical adsorption, altering the properties of the intestinal wall, or altering the bacterial flora of the intestine. The steady-state serum concentrations of digoxin and digitoxin can be affected if the changes in absorption are of sufficient magnitude, and adjustments in digoxin or digitoxin dosage may be required. A reduction in digoxin and digitoxin protein binding has occurred during concomitant administration of heparin and cardiac glycosides. Since digitoxin is more highly protein bound than digoxin, interactions that involve changes in protein binding are of much greater clinical importance with digitoxin. A number of drugs increase or decrease the elimination of digoxin and digitoxin, and subtherapeutic or toxic concentrations of the cardiac glycosides often result. Drugs that induce hepatic microsomal enzymes can increase the elimination of digitoxin, which is eliminated mainly by hepatic biotransformation. Digoxin is eliminated mainly by renal excretion; renal clearance of digoxin may be increased by vasodilators and thyroid hormones and decreased by quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, and potassium-sparing diuretics. The clinical importance of changes in serum concentrations of the cardiac glycosides that result from alterations in glycoside elimination requires further study, as does the importance of preliminary reports of interactions between cardiac glycosides and diazepam, captopril, and combination therapy with quinidine-pentobarbital or quinidine-rifampin. Because the cardiac glycosides have a narrow therapeutic range, patients receiving concomitant therapy with agents that might affect the absorption, distribution, or elimination of the cardiac glycosides should be monitored carefully for symptoms of digitalis toxicity or undertreatment."

Corticosteroids are widely prescribed in the HIV-positive population. However, digoxin is rarely used in HIV patients; hence, digoxin toxicity due to drug-drug interaction is not widely recognised. Nevertheless, this practice might change in the future as HIV cohorts of patients are ageing, due to the successful treatment of HIV infection with combination antiretroviral therapy. We report a case of digoxin toxicity in an HIV-positive 51-year-old man, due to a combination of drug-drug interaction and renal impairment. The first case report of digoxin toxicity due to drug-drug interaction with ritonavir in an HIV-positive woman was published in 2003. To the best of our knowledge, no similar case report has since been published in the literature. This case alerts the profession to the importance of drug-drug interaction and highlights the clinical features of digoxin toxicity."

134,Olitoriside,441207,0.987,"BACKGROUND: The cardiac glycoside digitoxin preferentially inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells and targets the Erk pathway. Digitoxin alters the expression of genes that mediate calcium metabolism and IAP genes.  PURPOSE: Since the optimal treatment for cancer involves the use of agents in combination, we assessed the growth inhibitory effects of digitoxin combined with agents that alter calcium metabolism, thapsigargin, a sarcoplasmic/ER Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor, and the statin simvastatin, as well as digitoxin's effect on the IAP pathway of apoptosis.  METHODS: To reveal signaling pathways, we treated human cancer cells with digitoxin, alone or combined with thapsigargin or simvastatin, and measured cell growth using the MTT and colony formation assays. We used histology and Western blot analysis of HEK293 cells to assay effects on IAPs.  RESULTS: Digitoxin inhibited the growth of breast, colon and ovarian cancer cells. Consistent with an effect on calcium metabolism, digitoxin exhibited synergy with thapsigargin and simvastatin on ER-negative breast cancer cells. Digitoxin activates expression of Erk pathway genes and suppresses expression of IAP genes. The growth inhibitory effects on HEK293 cells are not blocked by the pancaspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK, indicating that digitoxin may act by a caspase independent pathway of apoptosis. Furthermore, digitoxin does not have an effect on XIAP protein, a major anti-apoptotic protein.  CONCLUSION: Digitoxin appears to act through the Erk and stress response pathways and is worthwhile to study to prevent and treat cancer. Our findings warn of possible safety issues for cardiac patients who take a combination of digitoxin and statins."

137,Olitoriside,441207,0.987,"Cardiac glycoside toxicity may also cause various atrial and sinoatrial nodal arrhythmias and conduction disorders including atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atria flutter, atrial premature complexes, wandering atrial pacemaker, sinus bradycardia, sinoatrial arrest, sinoatrial exit block, and sinus tachycardia. Junctional premature complexes may also occur. Excessive slowing of the pulse rate may be a sign of cardiac glycoside toxicity, but mild resting bradycardia in the absence of other manifestations of toxicity may not necessitate withholding the glycoside. In patients with sinus node disease (ie, sick sinus syndrome), cardiac glycosides may worsen sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block, particularly in combination with other drugs that depress sinus node or AV conduction, such a beta-adrenergic blocking agents (beta-blockers) and certain nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers. /Cardiac glycosides/"

139,Olitoriside,439501,0.948,"Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of ouabain, a specific Na-K-ATPase inhibitor, in rats mimics the manic phenotypes of bipolar disorder and thus has been proposed as one of the best animal models of mania. Bipolar mania has been known to be associated with dysfunctions of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain area critically involved in mental functions; however, the exact mechanism underlying these dysfunctions is not yet clear. The present study investigated synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and dopamine release in Sprague-Dawley rat mPFC following ICV administration of ouabain (5 uL of 1 mM ouabain). The electrophysiological results demonstrated that ouabain depressed the short- and the long-term synaptic plasticity, represented by paired-pulse facilitation and long-term potentiation, respectively, in the mPFC. These ouabain-induced alterations in synaptic plasticity can be prevented by pre-treatment with lithium (intraperitoneal injection of 47.5 mg/kg lithium, twice a day, 7 days), which acts as an effective mood stabilizer in preventing mania. The electrochemical results demonstrated that ICV administration of ouabain enhanced dopamine release in the mPFC, which was not affected by pre-treatment with lithium. These findings suggested that alterations in synaptic plasticity and dopamine release in the mPFC might underlie the dysfunctions of mPFC accompanied with ouabain administration-induced bipolar mania."
140,Olitoriside,439501,0.948,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a well-known and well-studied neurotrophin. Most biological effects of BDNF are mediated by the activation of TrkB receptors. This neurotrophin regulates several neuronal functions as cell proliferation, viability, and differentiation. Ouabain is a steroid that binds to the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase, inducing the activation of several intracellular signaling pathways. Previous data from our group described that ouabain treatment increases retinal ganglion cells survival (RGC). The aim of the present study was to evaluate, if this cardiac glycoside can have a synergistic effect with BDNF, the classical trophic factor for retinal ganglion cells, as well as investigate the intracellular signaling pathways involved. Our work demonstrated that the activation of Src, PLC, and PKCdelta participates in the signaling cascade mediated by 50 ng/mL BDNF, since their selective inhibitors completely blocked the trophic effect of BDNF. We also demonstrated a synergistic effect on RGC survival when we concomitantly used ouabain (0.75 nM) and BDNF (10 ng/mL). Moreover, the signaling pathways involved in this synergistic effect include Src, PLC, PKCdelta, and JNK. Our results suggest that the synergism between ouabain and BDNF occurs through the activation of the Src pathway, JNK, PLC, and PKCdelta."
141,Olitoriside,439501,0.948,"The present study aimed to investigate the effects of mood stabilizers, specifically lithium (Li) and valproate (VPA), on mitochondrial superoxide, lipid peroxidation, and proteins involved in cell death signaling pathways in the brains of rats subjected to the ouabain-induced animal model of mania. Wistar rats received Li, VPA, or saline twice a day for 13 days. On the 7th day of treatment, the animals received a single intracerebroventricular injection of ouabain or aCSF. After the ICV injection, the treatment with mood stabilizers continued for 6 additional days. The locomotor activity of rats was measured using the open-field test. In addition, we analyzed oxidative stress parameters, specifically levels of phosphorylated p53 (pp53), BAX and Bcl-2 in the brain of rats by immunoblot. Li and VPA reversed ouabain-related hyperactivity. Ouabain decreased Bcl-2 levels and increased the oxidative stress parameters BAX and pp53 in the brains of rats. Li and VPA improved these ouabain-induced cellular dysfunctions; however, the effects of the mood stabilizers were dependent on the protein and brain region analyzed. These findings suggest that the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase can be an important link between oxidative damage and the consequent reduction of neuronal and glial density, which are both observed in BD, and that Li and VPA exert protective effects against ouabain-induced activation of the apoptosis pathway."

We investigated whether DHA-enriched avian glycerophospholipids (GPL-DHA) exert cardioprotection in ouabain-treated rats after 4 weeks of dietary supplementation with 10, 35 or 60 mg DHA per kg body weight versus none (DHA10, DHA35, DHA60 and control groups, respectively). The contractile responsiveness to different doses of ouabain (10(-7) to 10(-4) M), ouabain intoxication (at 3 X 10(-4) M), and relative variations in cardiac energy metabolism were determined using (31)P NMR in isolated perfused rat hearts. The fatty acid composition of cardiac membranes was analyzed by gas chromatography. DHA accretion in the heart was dose-dependent (+8%, +30% and +45% for DHA10, DHA35 and DHA60, respectively). The cardiac phosphocreatine content significantly increased at the baseline in DHA35 (+45%) and DHA60 groups (+85%), and at the different doses of ouabain in the DHA60 group (+73% to 98%). The maximum positive inotropy achieved at 10(-4) M ouabain was significantly increased in all DHA groups versus control (+150%, +122.5% and +135% for DHA10, DHA35 and DHA60, respectively), and ouabain intoxication was delayed. The increase in myocardial phosphocreatine content and the improved efficacy of ouabain on myocardial contraction without toxicity suggest the potential of GPL-DHA as a dietary supplement or ingredient for functional food, and possibly as a co-treatment with digitalis drugs in humans."

Each subject received an intravenous administration of 0.096 mg/kg of prednisolone hemisuccinate (PSL-HS) with or without pretreatment with 50 mg of oral glycyrrhizin four times. Blood samples were taken from a peripheral vein at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hr after the start of prednisolone-HS infusion. The concentrations of total prednisolone in plasma were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the free prednisolone was measured by an isocolloidosmolar equilibrium dialysis method. The pharmacokinetic parameters of prednisolone were determined by non-compartment analysis. Oral administration of glycyrrhizin was found to significantly increase the concentrations of total prednisolone at 6, 8 hr, and of free prednisolone at 4, 6 and 8 hr after prednisolone-hemisuccinate infusion. Moreover, oral administration of glycyrrhizin was also found to modify the pharmacokinetics of both total and free prednisolone. After oral administration of glycyrrhizin, the area under the curve (AUC) was significantly increased, the total plasma clearance (CL) was significantly decreased, and the mean residence time (MRT) was significantly prolonged. However, the volume of distribution (Vdss) showed no evident change. This suggests that oral administration of glycyrrhizin increases the plasma prednisolone concentrations and influences its pharmacokinetics by inhibiting its metabolism, but not by affecting its distribution."
147,Olitoriside,14982,0.769,"To clarify whether glycyrrhizin, the aqueous extract of licorice root and a drug for treatment of chronic active hepatitis, prevents the development of hepatic injury induced by carbon tetrachloride, allyl formate, and endotoxin, the present study was undertaken in rats. The treatment with glycyrrhizin 20 hr before carbon tetrachloride administration protected the development of the pericentral hepatocellular necrosis. Glycyrrhizin treatment 2 hr prior to the administration of allyl formate also inhibited the development of the periportal hepatocellular necrosis. However, glycyrrhizin did not protect the development of endotoxin-induced focal and random hepatocellular necrosis. These experimental results suggest that glycyrrhizin has no protective effect on hepatic injury following sinusoidal circulatory disturbance as seen in the case of endotoxin and that glycyrrhizin can protect against hepatotoxicity induced by the direct action on the hepatocytes due to hepatotoxins, such as carbon tetrachloride and allyl formate."

METHODS: Male SD rats were randomly allocated into a normal control group, a model control group, and a Potenlini group. Rats in the latter two groups were treated with CCl4 and Ethanol solution in order to induce chronic liver injury. Rats in Potenlini group were given Potenlini treatment at the same time. All rats were killed at the 9th week after CCl4 administration. Serum and liver specimens were collected, serum ALT activities and histological findings were assessed. Nuclear extracts from liver tissues were prepared and gel retardation assays were performed for the evaluation of NF-kappa B activity. RESULTS: (1) Serum ALT levels were significantly reduced in rats treated with Potenlini compared with those in rats of the model control group, which had dramatically increased ALT levels. (2) Histologically, liver steatosis and fibrosis were severe in the rats of the model group, but were significantly improved in rats of the Potenlini group. (3) NF-kappa B binding activity was markedly increased in the liver specimens taken from the rats of the model control group in comparison with the binding of normal livers, but the binding levels were nearly normal in the livers of the Potenlini group. CONCLUSION: Potenlini can inhibit the NF-kappa B binding activity in CCl4 and ethanol induced chronic liver injury, and that may partially be the mechanism by which Potenlini protects liver from hepatotoxin-induced liver injury and cirrhosis."
149,Odoratin,5280961,0.83,"Humans and wildlife are frequently exposed to mixtures of endocrine active-compounds (EAC). The objective of the present study was to investigate the potential of the phytoestrogen genistein to influence the reproductive developmental toxicity of the endocrine-active pesticide methoxychlor. Three levels of genistein (0, 300, or 800 ppm) and two levels of methoxychlor (0 or 800 ppm) were used in this study. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to the two compounds, either alone or in combinations, through dietary administration to dams during pregnancy and lactation and to the offspring directly after weaning. Both compounds, methoxychlor in particular, were associated with reduced body growth at 800 ppm, but pregnancy outcome was not affected by either treatment. An acceleration of vaginal opening (VO) in the exposed female offspring was the only observed effect of genistein at 300 ppm. Exposure to 800 ppm genistein or 800 ppm methoxychlor caused accelerated VO and also altered estrous cyclicity toward persistent estrus in the female offspring. The estrogenic responses to genistein and methoxychlor administered together were apparently accumulative of the effects associated with each compound alone. Methoxychlor, but not genistein, delayed preputial separation (PPS) in the male rats. When administered with methoxychlor, genistein at 800 ppm enhanced the effect of methoxychlor on delaying PPS. Genistein and methoxychlor treatment did not change gender-specific motor activity patterns in either sex. To explore possible mechanisms for interaction between the two compounds on development, we performed estrogen receptor (ER)- and androgen receptor (AR)-based in vitro transcriptional activation assays using genistein and the primary methoxychlor metabolite 2,2-bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (HPTE). While the in vitro assays supported the estrogenic effects of genistein and methoxychlor and the antiandrogenic effects of methoxychlor, the reactivity of these compounds with ERs alpha and beta could not predict the greater in vivo estrogenic potency of methoxychlor over genistein; nor could the potentiation of the methoxychlor effect on PPS by genistein be predicted based on in vitro HPTE and genistein reactions with the AR. Data from this study indicate that phytoestrogens are capable of altering the toxicological behaviors of other EACs, and the interactions of these compounds may involve complexities that are difficult to predict based on their in vitro steroid receptor reactivities.

The enhanced bioavailability of oral tamoxifen by oral kaempferol could have been due to an inhibition of CYP3A and P-gp by kaempferol.

On the other hand, there were no significant differences in the mean peak value time in plasma (T(max)) and the elimination half-life (t1/2(ke)) between the control and the treated groups. The concomitant oral use of kaempferol with nifedipine may influence the pharmacokinetic parameters of nifedipine in rats, which suggests that kaempferol might reduce the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine."

B(a)P administration led to induction of cytochrome P-450 (CYP), aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) and DNA strand breaks (P < 0.001), which was suppressed by apigenin (2.5 and 5 mg/kg orally) dose dependently (P < 0.001). B(a)P-induced depletion in the level of reduced glutathione (GSH), quinone reductase (QR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) was also shown to be restored by apigenin pre-treatment (P < 0.001). A simultaneous significant and dose-dependent reduction was noted in DNA strand breaks and in-vivo DNA damage (P < 0.001), which gives some insight into restoration of DNA integrity in modulator groups.

From the start of the experiment, rats were given weekly sc injections of azoxymethane (7.4 mg/kg body weight) for 10 weeks and sc injection of bombesin (40 ug/kg body weight) every other day, and from week 16, sc injections of apigenin (0.75 or 1.5 mg/kg body weight) every other day until the end of the experiment in week 45. Bombesin significantly increased the incidence of intestinal tumors and cancer metastasis to the peritoneum in week 45. It also significantly increased the labeling index of intestinal cancers. Although administration of apigenin at either dose with bombesin had little or no effect on the enhancement of intestinal carcinogenesis by bombesin, the location, histologic type, depth of involvement, infiltrating growth patterns and labeling index, it was found to decrease significantly the incidence of cancer metastasis. Apigenin significantly decreased the incidence of lymphatic vessel invasion of adenocarcinomas, which was enhanced by bombesin. In vitro experiments revealed that apigenin inhibited bombesin-enhanced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-9 expression."

The activation of activator protein-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB induced by UVB was dose-dependently inhibited by myricetin treatment. Western blot and kinase assay data revealed that myricetin inhibited Fyn kinase activity and subsequently attenuated UVB-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Pull-down assays revealed that myricetin competitively bound with ATP to suppress Fyn kinase activity. Importantly, myricetin exerted similar inhibitory effects compared with 4-amino-5-(4-chloro-phenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, a well-known pharmacologic inhibitor of Fyn. In vivo mouse skin data also revealed that myricetin inhibited Fyn kinase activity directly and subsequently attenuated UVB-induced COX-2 expression. Mouse skin tumorigenesis data clearly showed that pretreatment with myricetin significantly suppressed UVB-induced skin tumor incidence in a dose-dependent manner. Docking data suggest that myricetin is easily docked to the ATP-binding site of Fyn, which is located between the N and C lobes of the kinase domain. Overall, these results indicated that myricetin exerts potent chemopreventive activity mainly by targeting Fyn in skin carcinogenesis."

The objective of the present study was to investigate the potential of the phytoestrogen genistein to influence the reproductive developmental toxicity of the endocrine-active pesticide methoxychlor. Three levels of genistein (0, 300, or 800 ppm) and two levels of methoxychlor (0 or 800 ppm) were used in this study. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to the two compounds, either alone or in combinations, through dietary administration to dams during pregnancy and lactation and to the offspring directly after weaning. Both compounds, methoxychlor in particular, were associated with reduced body growth at 800 ppm, but pregnancy outcome was not affected by either treatment. An acceleration of vaginal opening (VO) in the exposed female offspring was the only observed effect of genistein at 300 ppm. Exposure to 800 ppm genistein or 800 ppm methoxychlor caused accelerated VO and also altered estrous cyclicity toward persistent estrus in the female offspring. The estrogenic responses to genistein and methoxychlor administered together were apparently accumulative of the effects associated with each compound alone. Methoxychlor, but not genistein, delayed preputial separation (PPS) in the male rats. When administered with methoxychlor, genistein at 800 ppm enhanced the effect of methoxychlor on delaying PPS. Genistein and methoxychlor treatment did not change gender-specific motor activity patterns in either sex. To explore possible mechanisms for interaction between the two compounds on development, we performed estrogen receptor (ER)- and androgen receptor (AR)-based in vitro transcriptional activation assays using genistein and the primary methoxychlor metabolite 2,2-bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (HPTE). While the in vitro assays supported the estrogenic effects of genistein and methoxychlor and the antiandrogenic effects of methoxychlor, the reactivity of these compounds with ERs alpha and beta could not predict the greater in vivo estrogenic potency of methoxychlor over genistein; nor could the potentiation of the methoxychlor effect on PPS by genistein be predicted based on in vitro HPTE and genistein reactions with the AR.

Induction of rats with isoproterenol (150 mg/kg body wt, ip) for 2 days resulted in a significant increase in the activities of serum and cardiac lysosomal hydrolases (beta-d-glucuronidase, beta-d-galactosidase, beta-d-N-acetylglucosaminidase, acid phosphatase and cathepsin-D). A significant increase in cardiac levels of sodium, calcium with a decrease in the level of potassium paralleled by abnormal activities of membrane-bound phosphatases (Na(+)-K(+) ATPase, Ca(2+) ATPase and Mg(2+) ATPase) were observed in the heart of ISO-administered rats. Cardiac TNF-alpha and COX-2 expressions were assessed by Western blotting. Cardiac TNF-alpha and COX-2 expressions were significantly elevated in ISO-intoxicated rats. Pre-co-treatment with alpha-mangostin (200mg/kg body wt.) orally for 8 days significantly attenuated these abnormalities and restored the levels to near normalcy when compared to ISO intoxicated group of rats. In conclusion, alpha-mangostin preserves the myocardial membrane integrity and extenuates anomalous TNF-alpha and COX-2 expressions by mitigating ISO-induced oxidative stress and cellular damage effectively.

Administration of testosterone alone increased arterial pressure, reduced heart rate (HR), and exacerbated the tachycardiac baroreflex response. Cocaine-treated animals showed resting bradycardia without changes in arterial pressure and baroreflex activity. Combined treatment with testosterone and cocaine did not affect baseline arterial pressure and HR, but reduced baroreflex-mediated tachycardia.

197,3-Hydroxystigmast-5-en-7-one,16051930,0.735,"Ritonavir and nelfinavir, although known as strong inhibitors, by contrast exhibit inducing properties when used concomitantly with steroid hormones."
198,3-Hydroxystigmast-5-en-7-one,16051930,0.735,Herbal preparations containing St John's Wort (Hypericum Perforatum) may induce the metabolism of estrogens and progestagens.
199,3-Hydroxystigmast-5-en-7-one,16051930,0.735,"Phenytoin and rifampin increase the serum concentrations of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG); this significantly decreases the serum concentration of free drug for some progestins, which is a special concern in patients using progestins for contraception. /Progestins/"
200,3-Hydroxystigmast-5-en-7-one,16051930,0.735,"Drug interaction data are not available for rifabutin, but because its structure is similar to that of rifampin, similar precautions with its use with progestins may be warranted. ... /Progestins/"
201,3-Hydroxystigmast-5-en-7-one,6230,0.7,The concomitant use of antibiotics and oral contraceptives should be included in the assessment of contraceptive failure. A case of unwanted adolescent pregnancy in an 18-year-old female who had a severe staphylococcal skin infection and an underlying chronic granulomatous disease is presented and discussed. She had been receiving semisynthetic penicillin (500 mg. of oxacillin sodium every 6 hours) for 6 weeks and reported not having a menstrual period for 40 days. She was also on an oral contraceptive (1 mg. norethindrone/0.035 mg. estradiol). Results of a beta subunit human chorionic gonadotropin in serum test confirmed that she was pregnant. Careful review of her contraceptive package and antibiotic prescription suggests that indeed she had faithfully followed directions with both medicines. She and her boyfriend and the family received counseling; a therapeutic abortion was done. Advising a different contraceptive method or an additional contraceptive modality may be indicated in adolescents taking longterm antibiotic medication.
202,3-Hydroxystigmast-5-en-7-one,6230,0.7,"... In a randomized, 2-way crossover study, 20 healthy female subjects received Treatments A and B. Treatment A consisted of a single dose of OrthoNovum containing 1 mg norethisterone (norethindrone) and 35 microg ethinyl estradiol. Treatment B consisted of bosentan, 125 mg b.i.d. for 7 days plus concomitant norethisterone and ethinyl estradiol on Day 7. Plasma concentrations of norethisterone and ethinyl estradiol were measured on days of oral contraceptive administration. In the absence of bosentan, the pharmacokinetics of norethisterone and ethinyl estradiol were characterized by Cmax and AUC0-infinity values (95% CI) of 9.8 (8.1, 11.9) ng/mL and 72.9 (57.0, 93.1) ng x hr/mL, and 53.0 (47.0, 59.9) pg/mL and 758 (655, 878) pg x hr/mL, respectively. Concomitant bosentan did not affect the Cmax but significantly decreased the AUC of norethisterone and ethinyl estradiol by 13.7% (-23.5, -2.6) and 31.0% (-40.5,-20.2), respectively. The maximum decrease in AUC of norethisterone and ethinyl estradiol in an individual subject was 56% and 66%, respectively. Bosentan decreases the AUC of norethisterone and ethinyl estradiol in healthy female subjects. In patients treated with bosentan, reduced efficacy of hormonal contraceptives should be considered."
203,3-Hydroxystigmast-5-en-7-one,6230,0.7,"The effects of phenytoin treatment on plasma concentrations of norethisterone (NET) was studied in 7 healthy female rhesus monkeys. Before phenytoin treatment was started each monkey received an oral dose of 0.5 mg NET and 2 weeks later the same dose was given intravenously. On both occasions, plasma concentrations of NET were measured at frequent intervals during 24 hours. The monkeys were given phenytoin daily orally for more than 4 weeks. The absorption of phenytoin was confirmed by plasma determinations of phenytoin. While still on phenytoin treatment, the monkeys were again given 0.5 mg NET orally and 2 weeks later i.v. and blood sampling was repeated. During phenytoin treatment, plasma NET concentrations were always below those found before treatment. Both at iv and oral administration, the areas under the plasma concentration vs time curve (AUC) were reduced to 55% of the pretreatment AUCs. No difference in plasma half-life was found during phenytoin treatment. The results of this study may suggest that women on antiepileptic treatment with phenytoin should be given an oral contraceptive with a comparatively high dose of the steroids to provide contraceptive efficacy."
204,3-Hydroxystigmast-5-en-7-one,6230,0.7,"The pharmacokinetics of norethisterone have been studied in 8 women during and one month after treatment with rifampicin (450--600 mg/day). Rifampicin caused a significant reduction in the AUC of a single dose of 1 mg norethisterone from 37.8 +/- 13.1 to 21.9 +/- 5.9 ng/mL X hr (p less than 0.01). The plasma norethisterone half life (beta-phase) was also reduced from 6.2 +/- 1.7 to 3.2 +/- 1.0 hr (p less than 0.0025). In one additional woman on long term oral contraceptive therapy the 12 hour plasma norethisterone concentration was reduced by rifampicin from 12.3 ng/mL to 2.3 ng/mL. Rifampicin caused a significant increase in antipyrine clearance, 6 beta-hydroxycortisol excretion and plasma gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activity but there was no significant correlations between changes in these indices of liver microsomal enzyme induction. There was a significant correlation between the percentage increase in antipyrine clearance and the percentage decrease in norethisterone AUC during rifampicin. The changes in norethisterone pharmacokinetics during rifampicin therapy are compatible with the known enzyme inducing effect of rifampicin."

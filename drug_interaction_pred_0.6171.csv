23,Noroxyhydrastinine,896,0.824,"... This prospective, randomized, double-blind study included 200 adults with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I. Patients received either 0.2 mg/kg melatonin or a placebo orally for premedication (n = 100 per group). Approximately 50 min later, subgroups of 10 melatonin and 10 placebo patients were administered various doses of propofol (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, or 2.4 mg/kg) or thiopental (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, or 6.0 mg/kg) for anesthetic induction. The ability of each patient to respond to the command, ""open your eyes,"" and the disappearance of the eyelash reflex were assessed 60 sec after the end of the injection of propofol or thiopental. Dose-response curves were determined by probit analysis. RESULTS: Melatonin premedication decreased thiopental ED50 values for loss of response to verbal command and eyelash reflex from 3.4 mg/kg (95% confidence interval, 3.2-3.5 mg/kg) and 3.7 mg/kg (3.5-3.9 mg/kg) to 2.7 mg/kg (2.6-2.9 mg/kg) and 2.6 mg/kg (2.5-2.7 mg/kg), respectively (P < 0.05). Corresponding propofol ED50 values decreased from 1.5 mg/kg (1.4-1.6 mg/kg) and 1.6 mg/kg (1.5-1.7 mg/kg) to 0.9 mg/kg (0.8-0.96 mg/kg) and 0.9 mg/kg (0.8-0.95 mg/kg), respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin premedication significantly decreased the doses of both propofol and thiopental required to induce anesthesia.",,,

Melatonin (1 nmol) had no significant effect. Application of Ap(4)A in combination with melatonin, evoked a significantly greater increase in tear secretion of 34.2 +/- 5.8% (N=11). This potentiating effect of melatonin was blocked by pretreating the cornea with a topical application of the melatonin receptor antagonist, luzindole (240 nmol).

25,Noroxyhydrastinine,896,0.824,"The present study was designed to investigate the potential protective effect of melatonin against the hepatic and renal toxicity of lead in male rats. Three groups of animals were used in this study (control, lead acetate-treated (100 mg/kg), and lead acetate plus melatonin (10 mg/kg) for 30 days. Levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) products, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, total glutathione (GSH), histopathological changes in the liver and kidneys were investigated. In addition, nuclear area (NA), nuclear volume (NV) and the ratio of nuclear volume/cellular volume (N/C) were measured in the liver. The results revealed increased LPO and decreased SOD, GSH, NA, NV and N/C in the studied organs of lead-treated rats. Histopathological observations showed severe damage in the liver and kidneys. Melatonin co-treatment to the lead-administered rats attenuated the increase of LPO and restored the activity of SOD and levels of GSH as well as the mean values of NA, NV and N/C. Also, the morphological damage in the liver and kidneys was reduced and the tissues appeared like those of controls.

26,Noroxyhydrastinine,896,0.824,"... In this study, the effect of melatonin against the toxicity of doxorubicin (DOX) was investigated in rats. Hemodynamic function, pathological and biochemical changes were determined in different treated hearts. /The/ findings showed that a significant protection by melatonin (6 mg/kg for 15 days, cumulative dose of 90 mg/kg) against the DOX-induced toxicity was observed. Cardiac function was improved and lipid peroxidation decreased after melatonin treatment. It is concluded that melatonin provides protection against doxorubicin toxicity via an attenuation of lipid peroxidation.",,,

48,Linoleic,985,0.945,"Immunosuppressant cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment can cause severe side effects. Patients taking immunosuppressant after organ transplantation often display hyperlipidemia and obesity. Elevated levels of free fatty acids have been linked to the etiology of metabolic syndromes, nonalcoholic fatty liver and steatohepatitis. The contribution of free fatty acids to CsA-induced toxicity is not known. In this study we explored the effect of palmitic acid on CsA-induced toxicity in HepG2 cells. CsA by itself at therapeutic exposure levels did not induce detectible cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells. Co-treatment of palmitic acid and CsA resulted in a dose dependent increase in cytotoxicity, suggesting that fatty acid could sensitize cells to CsA-induced cytotoxicity at the therapeutic doses of CsA. A synergized induction of caspase-3/7 activity was also observed, indicating that apoptosis may contribute to the cytotoxicity. We demonstrated that CsA reduced cellular oxygen consumption which was further exacerbated by palmitic acid, implicating that impaired mitochondrial respiration might be an underlying mechanism for the enhanced toxicity. Inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) attenuated palmitic acid and CsA induced toxicity, suggesting that JNK activation plays an important role in mediating the enhanced palmitic acid/CsA-induced toxicity. Our data suggest that elevated FFA levels, especially saturated FFA such as palmitic acid, may be predisposing factors for CsA toxicity, and patients with underlying diseases that would elevate free fatty acids may be susceptible to CsA-induced toxicity. Furthermore, hyperlipidemia/obesity resulting from immunosuppressive therapy may aggravate CsA-induced toxicity and worsen the outcome in transplant patients.",,,
49,Linoleic,985,0.945,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an increasingly common cause of chronic liver disease; however, no specific pharmacologic therapy has been shown to be effective in its treatment. The present study was designed to develop an experimental cell culture model of NASH using four kinds of fatty acids - palmitic acid (PA), stearic acid (SA), linoleic acid (LA), and oleic acid (OA) - and TNF-a, according to the two-hit hypothesis. The saturated fatty acids PA and SA are more cytotoxic than the unsaturated fatty acids OA and LA. Cellular lipid accumulation without cytotoxicity was more easily induced with the unsaturated fatty acids than with the saturated fatty acids. PA augmented TNF-a-induced cytotoxicity, while the unsaturated fatty acids attenuated TNF-a-induced cytotoxicity. In a mechanistic study, PA enhanced TNF-a-mediated apoptosis in the absence of oxidative stress, as determined by measuring the cellular glutathione and malondialdehyde levels. Moreover, PA inhibited the TNF-a-induced phosphorylation of AKT, but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase, indicating that inhibition of survival signaling pathways activated by TNF-a may explain the effects of PA on TNF-a-induced cytotoxicity.

We evaluated whether palmitic acid is directly associated with both insulin resistance and lipoapoptosis in mouse and human hepatocytes and the impact of oleic acid in the molecular mechanisms that mediate both processes. In human and mouse hepatocytes palmitic acid at a lipotoxic concentration triggered early activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related kinases, induced the apoptotic transcription factor CHOP, activated caspase 3 and increased the percentage of apoptotic cells. These effects concurred with decreased IR/IRS1/Akt insulin pathway. Oleic acid suppressed the toxic effects of palmitic acid on ER stress activation, lipoapoptosis and insulin resistance. Besides, oleic acid suppressed palmitic acid-induced activation of S6K1. This protection was mimicked by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of S6K1 in hepatocytes. ...",,,

The post-treatment with vanillin during the mutation expression time of cells after treatment with ethyl methanesulfonate also showed an enhancement of the frequency of mutations induced by ethyl methanesulfonate. However, vanillin suppressed the cytotoxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide when cells were post-treated with vanillin after hydrogen peroxide treatment. Vanillin showed no change in the absence of activity of hydrogen peroxide to induce mutations. Post-treatment with vanillin also suppressed the chromosome aberrations induced by hydrogen peroxide. The differential effects of vanillin were probably due to the quality of mutagen-induced DNA lesions and vanillin might influence at least two different kinds of cellular repair functions. The mechanisms by which vanillin enhances or suppresses chemical-induced cytotoxicity, mutations and chromosome aberrations are discussed.",,,
88,paeonol,1183,0.987,"Methotrexate (MTX), a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat cancer, produces cytogenetic damage and has a cytostatic effect in a variety of test systems. Several antigenotoxic agents have been studied in various in vitro and in vivo systems. However, data are limited regarding their ability to modulate MTX-induced genotoxicity. In the present study, vanillin (VA) and chlorophyllin (CHL) were used as antigenotoxic agents to study their ability to minimize the DNA damage caused by MTX. Exponentially growing V79 Chinese hamster lung cells were treated with MTX at five different concentrations (5-100 ug/mL) with S9 activation for 6 h and post-treated with two concentrations of either VA (50 or 100 ug/mL) or CHL (50 or 100 ug/mL) for 40 h. Cytochalasin B was added for the micronucleus (MN) assay along with antigenotoxic agents to evaluate MN in binucleated cells. Chromosomal aberrations were also evaluated in parallel cultures. Results indicate that MTX alone induced a dose-dependent decrease in the nuclear division index (NDI) and the mitotic index (MI). A significant increase in percent micronucleated binucleated cells (MNBN) and percent aberrant cells (Abs) was observed. Studies using VA as an antigenotoxic agent showed a decrease in the number of MNBN (26.3-83.1%) and Abs (16.0-87.5%) with the addition of either 50 or 100 micrograms VA/ml. The addition of CHL also significantly reduced the number of MNBN (53.0-91.5%) at both concentrations tested. Chromosomal aberrations were also significantly reduced (41.0-83.0). These studies indicate that both VA and CHL are capable of effectively minimizing MTX-induced chromosomal damage.",,,

However, the data on its effect against radiation-induced cytogenetic damage are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of on radiation-induced chromosomal damage in V79 cells. Exponentially growing cells were exposed to five doses of X-rays (1-12 Gy) and UV radiation (50-800 x 10(2)uJ/sq cm and posttreated with 3 concentrations of VA (5, 50 or 100 ug/mL for 16 hr for micronucleus (MN) and 18 h for structural chromosomal aberration (SCA) analyses. MN and SCA assays were performed concurrently according to standard procedures. Results indicate that there was a dose related increase in the percent of micronucleated binucleated cells (MNBN) (5.6 to 79.6) and percent of aberrant cells (Abs) (12 to 98) with X-ray treatment alone. Inhibition studies showed that the addition of VA at 100 VA ug/mL significantly reduced the percent of micronucleated binucleated cells (21 to 48) induced by X-ray at 1, 2, and 4 Gy. There was a slight decrease in percent micronucleated binucleated cells at 5 and 50 VA ug/mL. All three concentrations of VA decreased percent Abs (15.7 to 57.1) induced by X-rays at all doses. UV radiation alone significantly increased percent micronucleated binucleated cells (3.5 to 14.8) and percent Abs (17 to 29). Addition of 50 or 100 VA ug/mL, significantly decreased percent micronucleated binucleated cells (31.7 to 86.2) and percent Abs (54.5 to 90.9) at all doses of UV radiation. A decrease in percent micronucleated binucleated cells (2.8 to 72.4) and percent Abs (34.8 to 66.7) was also noted at 5 VA ug/mL. These data clearly indicate the protective effect of VA on radiation-induced chromosomal damage, suggesting that VA is an anticlastogenic agent.",,,

In this study, we examined whether several antimutagens, such as vanillin (VA) and CoCl2, modify the developmental toxicity of N-Methylnitrosourea given to pregnant mice at the preimplantation stage. ICR mice were treated with N-Methylnitrosourea at a single IP dose of 20 mg/kg on day 2.5 of gestation. A single IP dose of 50 mg/kg of vanillin or single IV dose of 10 mg/kg of CoCl2 was administered 1 hour after N-Methylnitrosourea treatment.

Both enzymes displayed reduced, CO-bound absorption spectra with lambda max of 452.5 nm. IVA1 and IVA3 hydroxylated lauric acid at the omega and omega-1 positions with equivalent omega/omega-1 ratios of about 12.5. IVA1 had a substrate turnover of 21/min which was about fourfold higher than that of IVA3. The omega and omega-1 hydroxylation of palmitic acid was also catalyzed by these P450s with combined turnover numbers for both metabolites of 45/min or 18/min for IVA1 and IVA3, respectively. The omega/omega-1 oxidation ratio of IVA1 for palmitate was 1.25 which was almost fourfold higher than that obtained for IVA3.

Ciprofibrate dependent hepatomegaly was observed at two dose levels (2 and 20 mg/kg) in all rat strains examined. A 10 to 15-fold induction in the 12-hydroxylation of lauric acid with a less marked 1.5 to 5-fold induction of 11-hydroxylation was observed in treated animals. This dose-dependent increase in fatty acid hydroxylase activity was associated with a maximal 10-fold increase in the specific content of cytochrome p-450 IVA1 isoenzyme apoprotein, as assessed immunochemically using an ELISA technique. The activities of the cytochrome p-450 I (IA1 and IA2) and II (IIB1 and IIB2) families, as measured by ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and benzphetamine-N-demethylase activities respectively, were decreased on treatment. In the mitochondria, monoamine oxidase activity was significantly decreased at the higher dose level whereas alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity was elevated. Total carnitine acetyltransferase activity (mitochondrial and peroxisomal) and peroxisomal beta-oxidation were markedly increased at both dose levels in all strains examined. Cytosolic glutathione peroxidase activity, measured using both t-butylhydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide as substrates, was decreased on treatment to approximately 50% of the control value. In treated animals, a marked increase in mRNA levels coding for cytochrome p-450 IVA1 and the peroxisomal bifunctional protein of the fatty acid beta-oxidation spiral was observed. However, mRNA levels coding for glutathione peroxidase appeared unchanged following ciprofibrate administration, in contrast to the above-noted decrease of glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity. Taken collectively, our results have further substantiated a close association between the induction of microsomal cytochrome p-450 IVA1, peroxisomal beta-oxidation and total carnitine acetyltransferase activity in rat liver, and have performed a conceptual basis for the rationalization of the chronic toxicity of peroxisome proliferators in this species.",,,

Oil/water partitioning data and rotating diffusion cell measurements, in the presence of the fatty acids, suggested that the enhanced flux of the cationic naphazoline could be accounted for by an increase in lipophilicity through ion pairing with the carboxylate anion of the acid. Both neutral caffeine and sodium salicylate were incapable of forming ion pairs; consequently, increases in skin permeability are also due to a disruption of the stratum corneum.

To investigate possible hepatoprotective effects in birds, standardized extracts (80%) of silymarin from milk thistle were tested in white Carneaux pigeons (Columba livia). Pigeons were separated into 3 groups and fed diets formulated to provide milk thistle at a level of 0, 10, or 100 mg/kg body weight per day. After acclimation, the birds were challenged with B1 aflatoxin (3 mg/kg body weight for 2 consecutive days) by oral gavage. Liver function then was assessed by hematologic testing and plasma biochemical analysis, liver histopathology, and hepatobiliary scintigraphy. Results of histopathology and hepatobiliary scintigraphy showed no protective effects from milk-thistle administration. Aflatoxin challenge resulted in hepatic inflammation and necrosis, biliary-duct hyperplasia, and lymphocyte infiltration. All hepatobiliary scintigraphy elements increased significantly after aflatoxin challenge. Bile acid levels and plasma enzyme concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine phosphokinase all increased after aflatoxin exposure and were mostly unchanged with consumption of milk thistle. Only birds fed 10 mg/kg body weight milk thistle showed significant reductions in lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine phosphokinase concentrations after aflatoxin exposure.

188,liquiritin,5213,0.841,"Milk thistle (Silybum marianum) has been used in humans for the treatment of liver disease because of its antioxidant properties and its ability to stabilize cell membranes and regulate cell permeability. To investigate possible hepatoprotective effects in birds, standardized extracts (80%) of silymarin from milk thistle were tested in white Carneaux pigeons (Columba livia). Pigeons were separated into 3 groups and fed diets formulated to provide milk thistle at a level of 0, 10, or 100 mg/kg body weight per day. After acclimation, the birds were challenged with B1 aflatoxin (3 mg/kg body weight for 2 consecutive days) by oral gavage. Liver function then was assessed by hematologic testing and plasma biochemical analysis, liver histopathology, and hepatobiliary scintigraphy. Results of histopathology and hepatobiliary scintigraphy showed no protective effects from milk-thistle administration. Aflatoxin challenge resulted in hepatic inflammation and necrosis, biliary-duct hyperplasia, and lymphocyte infiltration. All hepatobiliary scintigraphy elements increased significantly after aflatoxin challenge. Bile acid levels and plasma enzyme concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine phosphokinase all increased after aflatoxin exposure and were mostly unchanged with consumption of milk thistle. Only birds fed 10 mg/kg body weight milk thistle showed significant reductions in lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine phosphokinase concentrations after aflatoxin exposure. Our results show that consumption of milk thistle is not associated with hepatoprotective effects against acute B1 aflatoxin exposure in pigeons.",,,

We report the case of a patient with chronic renal failure who had been taking simvastatin for 2 years and developed acute weakness 2 weeks after the start of treatment with colchicines for recurrent gout. The electromyography and elevated muscle enzymes indicated that his symptoms were caused by myopathy. When this patient stopped taking both drugs, his weakness resolved rapidly. Acute myopathy induced by combination therapy with colchicines and simvastatin is rare. In patients with chronic renal failure, co-administration of colchicine with simvastatin may accelerate the onset of myopathy because CYP3A4 (part of cytochrome P450) is crucial in the breakdown of both drugs. When adding colchicine to a medication regimen that includes a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor for patients with renal insufficiency, drugs that are metabolized outside the CYP3A4 system (e.g., fluvastatin and pravastatin) should be selected instead.",,,

This study was aimed to test whether piperonal attenuates visceral adiposity induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) in mice and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.  METHODS AND RESULTS: Male C57BL/6N mice were fed a normal diet, HFD, or 0.05% piperonal-supplemented HFD (PSD) for 10 weeks. PSD-fed mice showed attenuation of body weight gain, total visceral fat pad weights, and plasma lipid levels compared to HFD-fed mice. Piperonal supplementation of the HFD increased the mRNA expression of certain isotypes of adenylate cyclase (Adcy) and protein kinase A (PKA) in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of mice. The adipogenesis-related genes were downregulated, whereas fatty acid oxidation- and thermogenesis-related genes were upregulated in the WAT of PSD-fed mice compared to those in HFD-fed mice. Piperonal directly activated Adcy by decreasing the Km for its substrate (ATP) in plasma membranes prepared from the WAT of mice. Furthermore, piperonal-induced inhibition of adipocyte differentiation and elevation of Adcy and PKA activities in 3T3-L1 cells were abrogated by an Adcy inhibitor.

A single dose of PQ (50 mg/kg, i.p.) was intraperitoneally given to induce acute lung injury. Then mice were treated with CH (10 and 20 mg/kg/day, orally) for 7 days. At the end of the experiment, animals were euthanized and then bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues were collected for histological observation, biochemical analysis, and Western blot analysis. Malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) levels in BALF were determined. The levels of SOD and MDA in the lung were also detected. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway proteins in the lung were determined by Western blot. Histological examination indicated that CH attenuated lung inflammation caused by PQ. Biochemical results showed that CH treatment significantly reduced the levels of MDA, MPO, and inflammatory cytokines and increased the level of SOD, compared to those in the PQ group. Meanwhile, Western Blot results revealed that CH increased PPAR-gamma expression and inhibited NF-kappaB pathway activation after PQ challenge. These findings suggested the potential therapeutic effects of CH which is derived from a natural product on PQ-induced pulmonary injury.",,,

AST2017-01 and chrysophanol relieved clinical severity in AD-like skin lesions and significantly decreased scratching behavior. The thickness of epidermis and infiltration of inflammatory cells in AD-like skin lesions were reduced by AST2017-01 or chrysophanol. AST2017-01 and chrysophanol significantly suppressed the levels of histamine, immunoglobulin E, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-a in serum of AD mice. The protein levels of TSLP, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 were significantly inhibited in the skin lesions. The mRNA expressions of TSLP, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine/CCL17, and C-C chemokine receptor 3 were inhibited in the skin lesions by AST2017-01 or chrysophanol.

403,Isovanillin,10208,0.906,"Nitrosative/oxidative stress plays an important role in neuronal death following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Chrysophanol (CHR) has been shown to afford significant neuroprotection on ischemic stroke, however, whether its mechanism is related to attenuating nitrosative/oxidative stress is not clear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of CHR on neuronal injury related to nitric oxide (NO) production by using mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Our results revealed that nitrite plus nitrate (NOx-) and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) levels increased in ischemic brain 14 days after reperfusion, and were subsequently attenuated by CHR treatment. Moreover, 3-NT is colocalized with NeuN and TUNEL, suggesting that neuronal apoptosis following I/R is associated with 3-NT and CHR suppresses NO-associated neuronal cell death. Accordingly, cleaved caspase-3 expression in ischemic brain was decreased by CHR treatment. I/R also decreased the activity of total superoxide dismutase (SOD) and manganese-dependent SOD (MnSOD), whilst increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production significantly. Interestingly, CHR reversed this decrease in total SOD, and MnSOD activity, and inhibited ROS generation in the ischemic brain. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence suggesting that CHR attenuates nitrosative/oxidative stress injury induced by I/R, providing a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.",,,

Four weeks of further injection with vehicle, TP, TP + CA, TP + finasteride was carried on. In the CA treatment group, the prostate weight was reduced and the TP-induced histological changes were restored as the normal control group. CA treatment suppressed the TP-elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) expression. In addition, 5a-reductase, a crucial factor in BPH development, was suppressed to the normal level close to the control group by CA treatment. The elevated expressions of androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor a and steroid receptor coactivator 1 by TP administration were also inhibited in the CA group when compared to the TP-induced BPH group. Then we evaluated the changes in three major factors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase chain during prostatic hyperplasia; extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38). While ERK was elevated in the process of BPH, JNK and p38 was not changed. This up-regulated ERK was also reduced as normal by CA treatment.

Osthole, a natural coumarin found in traditional Chinese medicinal herbs, has therapeutic potential in the treatment of various diseases. In this study, we investigated the effects of osthole against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. Mice were administered osthole (100 mg/kg per day, ip) for 3 d, then on the fourth day APAP (300 mg/kg, ip) was co-administered with osthole. The mice were euthanized post-APAP, their serum and livers were collected for analysis. Pretreatment with osthole significantly attenuated APAP-induced hepatocyte necrosis and the increases in ALT and AST activities. Compared with the mice treated with APAP alone, osthole pretreatment significantly reduced serum MDA levels and hepatic H2O2 levels, and improved liver GSH levels and the GSSG-to-GSH ratio. Meanwhile, osthole pretreatment markedly alleviated the APAP-induced up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines in the livers, and inhibited the expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, but it increased the expression of hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and sulfotransferases (SULTs). Furthermore, osthole pretreatment reversed APAP-induced reduction of hepatic cAMP levels, but pretreatment with H89, a potent selective PKA inhibitor, failed to abolish the beneficial effect of osthole, whereas pretreatment with L-buthionine sulfoximine, a GSH synthesis inhibitor, abrogated the protective effects of osthole on APAP-induced liver injury, and abolished osthole-caused alterations in APAP-metabolizing enzymes. In cultured murine primary hepatocytes and Raw264.7 cells, however, osthole (40 umol/L) did not alleviate APAP-induced cell death, but it significantly suppressed APAP-caused elevation of inflammatory cytokines. Collectively, we have demonstrated that osthole exerts a preventive effect against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity by inhibiting the metabolic activation of APAP and enhancing its clearance through an antioxidation mechanism.",,,
418,Zosimin,10228,0.783,"Inflammation and oxidative stress are implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Osthole is a compound that is extracted from She Chuang Zi, which is a type of traditional Chinese medicine. Osthole has previously been demonstrated to exhibit anticancer activities and has a low toxicity. However, to the best of our knowledge, the anti-inflammatory effects of osthole in microglial cells have not been investigated extensively. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential protective effects of osthole against inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in microglial cells. The present study employed LPS-stimulated BV2 mouse microglia to establish an inflammatory cell model and to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of osthole. Cells were pretreated with osthole for 1 hr prior to LPS (10 ug/mL) stimulation. At 6 hr after the addition of LPS, alterations in the levels of inflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1beta, were determined by ELISA. Furthermore, at 24 hr after the addition of LPS, western blot analysis was performed to analyze the alterations in the protein expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65, phosphorylated-NF-kappaB p65, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase (HO)-1. The results demonstrated that the secretion of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-1beta by LPS-stimulated BV2 cells was significantly reduced by osthole treatment. Simultaneously, osthole treatment inhibited the LPS-induced activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. In addition, osthole upregulated the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Based on these results, osthole may exhibit anti-inflammatory effects via the NF-kappaB and Nrf2 pathways, indicating that osthole has the potential to be developed into an effective anti-inflammatory drug.",,,
419,Zosimin,10228,0.783,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an insidious and progressive disease that is triggered by various cardiopulmonary diseases. Inflammation has an important role in the progression of PAH. Osthole (Ost) is a coumarin that has clear anti-inflammatory properties. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of Ost on PAH, and to explore the mechanism underlying this effect. Using the monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH rat model, the effects of Ost on PAH were investigated. Rats were subcutaneously administered a single dose of MCT (50 mg/kg) to establish the PAH model, followed by daily treatment with Ost (10 or 20 mg/kg) by gavage for 28 days. The mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) was measured and histological analysis was performed. The results demonstrated that Ost significantly decreased mPAP, and reduced thickening of the pulmonary artery, compared with in rats in the MCT group. To further determine whether the effects of Ost on MCT-induced PAH were associated with inflammatory responses, the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65 signaling pathway was investigated by western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that Ost increased inhibition of the NF-kappaB p65 signaling pathway. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate that Ost may suppress the progression of MCT-induced PAH in rats, which may be, at least partially, mediated through modulation of the NF-kappaB p65 signaling pathway.",,,
420,Zosimin,10228,0.783,"Osthole, a natural coumarin found in traditional Chinese medicinal plants, has shown multiple biological activities. In the present study, we investigated the preventive effects of osthole on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Colitis was induced in mice by infusing TNBS into the colonic lumen. Before TNBS treatment, the mice received osthole (100 mg/kg par day, ip) for 3 d. Pretreatment with osthole significantly ameliorated the clinical scores, colon length shortening, colonic histopathological changes and the expression of inflammatory mediators in TNBS-induced colitis. Pretreatment with osthole elevated serum cAMP levels; but treatment with the PKA inhibitor H89 (10 mg/kg per d, ip) did not abolish the beneficial effects of osthole on TNBS-induced colitis. In mouse peritoneal macrophages, pretreatment with osthole (50 umol/L) significantly attenuated the LPS-induced elevation of cytokines at the mRNA level; inhibition of PKA completely reversed the inhibitory effects of osthole on IL-1beta, IL-6, COX2, and MCP-1 but not on TNFa. In Raw264.7 cells, the p38 inhibitor SB203580 markedly suppressed LPS-induced upregulation of the cytokines, whereas the PKA inhibitors H89 or KT5720 did not abolish the inhibitory effects of SB203580. Moreover, in LPS-stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages, SB203580 strongly inhibited the restored expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, COX2, and MCP-1, which was achieved by abolishing the suppressive effects of osthole with the PKA inhibitors. Western blot analysis showed that osthole significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of p38, which was induced by TNBS in mice or by LPS in Raw264.7 cells. Inhibition of PKA partially reversed the suppressive effects of osthole on p38 phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated cells. Collectively, our results suggest that osthole is effective in the prevention of TNBS-induced colitis by reducing the expression of inflammatory mediators and attenuating p38 phosphorylation via both cAMP/PKA-dependent and independent pathways, among which the cAMP/PKA-independent pathway plays a major role.",,,

Each subject received an intravenous administration of 0.096 mg/kg of prednisolone hemisuccinate (PSL-HS) with or without pretreatment with 50 mg of oral glycyrrhizin four times. Blood samples were taken from a peripheral vein at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hr after the start of prednisolone-HS infusion. The concentrations of total prednisolone in plasma were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the free prednisolone was measured by an isocolloidosmolar equilibrium dialysis method. The pharmacokinetic parameters of prednisolone were determined by non-compartment analysis. Oral administration of glycyrrhizin was found to significantly increase the concentrations of total prednisolone at 6, 8 hr, and of free prednisolone at 4, 6 and 8 hr after prednisolone-hemisuccinate infusion. Moreover, oral administration of glycyrrhizin was also found to modify the pharmacokinetics of both total and free prednisolone. After oral administration of glycyrrhizin, the area under the curve (AUC) was significantly increased, the total plasma clearance (CL) was significantly decreased, and the mean residence time (MRT) was significantly prolonged. However, the volume of distribution (Vdss) showed no evident change.

Glycyrrhizin treatment 2 hr prior to the administration of allyl formate also inhibited the development of the periportal hepatocellular necrosis. However, glycyrrhizin did not protect the development of endotoxin-induced focal and random hepatocellular necrosis. These experimental results suggest that glycyrrhizin has no protective effect on hepatic injury following sinusoidal circulatory disturbance as seen in the case of endotoxin and that glycyrrhizin can protect against hepatotoxicity induced by the direct action on the hepatocytes due to hepatotoxins, such as carbon tetrachloride and allyl formate.",,,

METHODS: Male SD rats were randomly allocated into a normal control group, a model control group, and a Potenlini group. Rats in the latter two groups were treated with CCl4 and Ethanol solution in order to induce chronic liver injury. Rats in Potenlini group were given Potenlini treatment at the same time. All rats were killed at the 9th week after CCl4 administration. Serum and liver specimens were collected, serum ALT activities and histological findings were assessed. Nuclear extracts from liver tissues were prepared and gel retardation assays were performed for the evaluation of NF-kappa B activity. RESULTS: (1) Serum ALT levels were significantly reduced in rats treated with Potenlini compared with those in rats of the model control group, which had dramatically increased ALT levels. (2) Histologically, liver steatosis and fibrosis were severe in the rats of the model group, but were significantly improved in rats of the Potenlini group. (3) NF-kappa B binding activity was markedly increased in the liver specimens taken from the rats of the model control group in comparison with the binding of normal livers, but the binding levels were nearly normal in the livers of the Potenlini group. CONCLUSION: Potenlini can inhibit the NF-kappa B binding activity in CCl4 and ethanol induced chronic liver injury, and that may partially be the mechanism by which Potenlini protects liver from hepatotoxin-induced liver injury and cirrhosis.",,,

This study examined the effects of noncontingent and contingent administration of THC on intravenous heroin self-administration in rhesus monkeys. Self-administration of different unit doses of heroin (0.0001-0.1 mg/kg/infusion) generated a typical inverted U-shaped dose-response curve. In one experiment (n=4), noncontingent THC (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) dose dependently shifted the heroin dose-response curve downward in three monkeys and slightly leftward in one monkey. In a second experiment (n=4), monkeys could self-administer THC alone (0.0032-0.032 mg/kg/infusion), heroin alone, or a mixture of THC and heroin. THC alone did not maintain responding above that obtained with saline; however, increasing the THC dose with heroin dose dependently decreased the number of infusions received and the rate of responding, as compared with data that were obtained with heroin alone. These results indicate that THC does not significantly enhance the positive reinforcing effects of heroin, further supporting the view that combining cannabinoid and opioid receptor agonists (e.g., for treating pain) does not increase, and might decrease, the abuse liability of individual drugs.",,,
502,Glabranin,16078,0.703,"Although it is more common for drug abuse to progress from tobacco to cannabis, in many cases cannabis use develops before tobacco use. Epidemiological evidence indicates that prior cannabis use increases the likelihood of becoming dependent on tobacco. To determine whether this effect might be due to cannabis exposure per se, in addition to any genetic, social, or environmental factors that might contribute, we extended our series of studies on 'gateway drug' effects in animal models of drug abuse. Rats were exposed to THC, the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, for 3 days (two intraperitoneal injections/day). Then, starting 1 week later, they were allowed to self-administer nicotine intravenously. THC exposure increased the likelihood of acquiring the nicotine self-administration response from 65% in vehicle-exposed rats to 94% in THC-exposed rats. When the price of nicotine was manipulated by increasing the response requirement, THC-exposed rats maintained higher levels of intake than vehicle-exposed rats, indicating that THC exposure increased the value of nicotine reward. These results contrast sharply with our earlier findings that prior THC exposure did not increase the likelihood of rats acquiring either heroin or cocaine self-administration, nor did it increase the reward value of these drugs. The findings obtained here suggest that a history of cannabis exposure might have lasting effects that increase the risk of becoming addicted to nicotine.",,,
503,Glabranin,16078,0.703,"BACKGROUND: Recently, high-dose oral synthetic delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was shown to alleviate cannabis withdrawal symptoms. The present data describe cannabinoid pharmacokinetics in chronic, daily cannabis smokers who received high-dose oral THC pharmacotherapy and later a smoked cannabis challenge. METHODS: Eleven daily cannabis smokers received 0, 30, 60, or 120 mg/d THC for four 5-day-medication sessions, each separated by 9 days of ad libitum cannabis smoking. On the fifth day, participants were challenged with smoking one 5.9% THC cigarette. Plasma collected on the first and fifth days was quantified by two-dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometer for THC, 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC), and 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THCCOOH). Linear ranges (ng/mL) were 0.5-100 for THC, 1-50 for 11-OH-THC, and 0.5-200 for THCCOOH. RESULTS: During placebo dosing, THC, 11-OH-THC, and THCCOOH concentrations consistently decreased, whereas all cannabinoids increased dose dependently during active dronabinol administration. THC increase over time was not significant after any dose, 11-OH-THC increased significantly during the 60- and 120-mg/d doses, and THCCOOH increased significantly only during the 120-mg/d dose. THC, 11-OH-THC, and THCCOOH concentrations peaked within 0.25 hours after cannabis smoking, except after 120 mg/d THC when THCCOOH peaked 0.5 hours before smoking. CONCLUSIONS: The significant withdrawal effects noted during placebo dronabinol administration were supported by significant plasma THC and 11-OH-THC concentration decreases. During active dronabinol dosing, significant dose-dependent increases in THC and 11-OH-THC concentrations support withdrawal symptom suppression. THC concentrations after cannabis smoking were only distinguishable from oral THC doses for 1 hour, too short a period to feasibly identify cannabis relapse. THCCOOH/THC ratios were higher 14 hours after overnight oral dronabinol abstinence but cannot distinguish oral THC dosing from the smoked cannabis intake.",,,
504,Glabranin,16078,0.703,"Methamphetamine (METH) is a potent psychostimulant with neurotoxic properties. Heavy use increases the activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), production of peroxynitrites, microglia stimulation, and induces hyperthermia and anorectic effects. Most METH recreational users also consume cannabis. Preclinical studies have shown that natural (delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, delta9-THC) and synthetic cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptor agonists exert neuroprotective effects on different models of cerebral damage. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of delta9-THC on METH-induced neurotoxicity by examining its ability to reduce astrocyte activation and nNOS overexpression in selected brain areas. Rats exposed to a METH neurotoxic regimen (4x10 mg/kg, 2 hours apart) were pre- or post-treated with delta9-THC (1 or 3 mg/kg) and sacrificed 3 days after the last METH administration. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against nNOS and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP). Results showed that, as compared to corresponding controls (i) METH-induced nNOS overexpression in the caudate-putamen (CPu) was significantly attenuated by pre- and post-treatment with both doses of delta9-THC (-19% and -28% for 1 mg/kg pre- and post-treated animals; -25% and -21% for 3 mg/kg pre- and post-treated animals); (ii) METH-induced GFAP-immunoreactivity (IR) was significantly reduced in the CPu by post-treatment with 1 mg/kg delta9-THC1 (-50%) and by pre-treatment with 3 mg/kg delta9-THC (-53%); (iii) METH-induced GFAP-IR was significantly decreased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) by pre- and post-treatment with both doses of delta9-THC (-34% and -47% for 1 mg/kg pre- and post-treated animals; -37% and -29% for 3 mg/kg pre- and post-treated animals). The cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A attenuated METH-induced nNOS overexpression in the CPu, but failed to counteract the delta9-THC-mediated reduction of METH-induced GFAP-IR both in the PFC and CPu. Our results indicate that delta9-THC reduces METH-induced brain damage via inhibition of nNOS expression and astrocyte activation through CB1-dependent and independent mechanisms, respectively.",,,

The brominated flame-retardant (BFR) 1, 2-dibromo-4-(1, 2-dibromoethyl) cyclohexane (TBECH), is an agonist to human, chicken and zebrafish AR. Recently another group of alternative BFRs, allyl 2, 4, 6-tribromophenyl ether (ATE), and 2, 3-dibromopropyl 2, 4, 6-tribromophenyl ether (DPTE) along with its metabolite 2-bromoallyl 2, 4, 6-tribromophenyl ether (BATE) were identified as potent human AR antagonists. These alternative BFRs are present in the environment. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of mixed exposures to the AR agonist and the AR antagonists at environmentally relevant concentrations. In vitro reporter luciferase assay showed that the AR antagonists, when present at concentration higher than TBECH, were able to inhibit TBECH-mediated AR activity. These AR antagonists also promoted AR nuclear translocation. In vitro gene expression analysis in the non-tumorigenic human prostate epithelial cell RWPE1 showed that TBECH induced AR target genes whereas DPTE repressed these genes. Further analysis of steroidogenic genes showed that TBECH up-regulated most of the genes while DPTE down-regulated the same genes. The results indicate that when TBECH and DPTE are present together they will antagonize each other, thereby reducing their individual effects.",,,

These drugs are effective and widely prescribed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Seven statins are currently available: atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin. Although these drugs are generally well tolerated, skeletal muscle abnormalities from myalgia to severe lethal rhabdomyolysis can occur. Factors that increase statin concentrations such as drug-drug interactions can increase the risk of these adverse events. Drug-drug interactions are dependent on statins' pharmacokinetic profile: simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin are metabolized through cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, while the metabolism of the other statins is independent of this CYP. All statins are substrate of organic anion transporter polypeptide 1B1, an uptake transporter expressed in hepatocyte membrane that may also explain some drug-drug interactions. Many HIV-infected patients have dyslipidemia and comorbidities that may require statin treatment. HIV-protease inhibitors (HIV PIs) are part of recommended antiretroviral treatment in combination with two reverse transcriptase inhibitors. All HIV PIs except nelfinavir are coadministered with a low dose of ritonavir, a potent CYP3A inhibitor to improve their pharmacokinetic properties.

To determine the ruggedness of our systems, the antibiotic susceptibilities of these biofilms were assessed with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin. The biofilm bacteria produced in the RDR were shown to display remarkable tolerance to 10 mug/ml of ciprofloxacin, thus mimicking the tolerance observed in recalcitrant bacterial infections. These studies further demonstrate that a nonmucoid strain of P. aeruginosa can form a biofilm that tolerates ciprofloxacin at clinically relevant concentrations. Neither asiatic acid nor corosolic acid reduced the viable cell density of P. aeruginosa biofilms.

Rat hepatocytes were isolated by two-step collagenase perfusion and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. Protective effects of asiatic acid (AA) and beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) were evaluated on hepatocytes injured by D-GalN (2 mmol/L) or CCl4 (10 mmol/L). Cell morphology was observed by light microscope, cell viability was measured by MTT assay, AST and LDH were determined by an automatic analyzer. Fluorescence assay was applied to test reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide end products (NOx) and reduced glutathione (GSH), and JC-1 staining was used to determine mitochondria membrane potential (DeltaPsim). AST and LDH in medium were decreased when treated with AA and GA after D-GalN injury (P<0.05), furthermore AA enhanced the hepatocyte viability (P<0.05). Moreover, AA and GA significantly reduced ROS and NOx generation, and ameliorated DeltaPsim lost induced by D-GalN. AA also inhibited GSH decrease due to D-GalN and CCl4 treatment. Both AA and GA could protect hepatocytes from D-GalN and CCl4 injuries, which is associated with reducing intracellular ROS and NOx, reversing GSH depression and ameliorating DeltaPsim lost.",,,

Bipolar mania has been known to be associated with dysfunctions of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain area critically involved in mental functions; however, the exact mechanism underlying these dysfunctions is not yet clear. The present study investigated synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and dopamine release in Sprague-Dawley rat mPFC following ICV administration of ouabain (5 uL of 1 mM ouabain). The electrophysiological results demonstrated that ouabain depressed the short- and the long-term synaptic plasticity, represented by paired-pulse facilitation and long-term potentiation, respectively, in the mPFC. These ouabain-induced alterations in synaptic plasticity can be prevented by pre-treatment with lithium (intraperitoneal injection of 47.5 mg/kg lithium, twice a day, 7 days), which acts as an effective mood stabilizer in preventing mania. The electrochemical results demonstrated that ICV administration of ouabain enhanced dopamine release in the mPFC, which was not affected by pre-treatment with lithium.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate, if this cardiac glycoside can have a synergistic effect with BDNF, the classical trophic factor for retinal ganglion cells, as well as investigate the intracellular signaling pathways involved. Our work demonstrated that the activation of Src, PLC, and PKCdelta participates in the signaling cascade mediated by 50 ng/mL BDNF, since their selective inhibitors completely blocked the trophic effect of BDNF. We also demonstrated a synergistic effect on RGC survival when we concomitantly used ouabain (0.75 nM) and BDNF (10 ng/mL).

Wistar rats received Li, VPA, or saline twice a day for 13 days. On the 7th day of treatment, the animals received a single intracerebroventricular injection of ouabain or aCSF. After the ICV injection, the treatment with mood stabilizers continued for 6 additional days. The locomotor activity of rats was measured using the open-field test. In addition, we analyzed oxidative stress parameters, specifically levels of phosphorylated p53 (pp53), BAX and Bcl-2 in the brain of rats by immunoblot. Li and VPA reversed ouabain-related hyperactivity. Ouabain decreased Bcl-2 levels and increased the oxidative stress parameters BAX and pp53 in the brains of rats. Li and VPA improved these ouabain-induced cellular dysfunctions; however, the effects of the mood stabilizers were dependent on the protein and brain region analyzed. These findings suggest that the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase can be an important link between oxidative damage and the consequent reduction of neuronal and glial density, which are both observed in BD, and that Li and VPA exert protective effects against ouabain-induced activation of the apoptosis pathway.",,,

The contractile responsiveness to different doses of ouabain (10(-7) to 10(-4) M), ouabain intoxication (at 3 X 10(-4) M), and relative variations in cardiac energy metabolism were determined using (31)P NMR in isolated perfused rat hearts. The fatty acid composition of cardiac membranes was analyzed by gas chromatography. DHA accretion in the heart was dose-dependent (+8%, +30% and +45% for DHA10, DHA35 and DHA60, respectively). The cardiac phosphocreatine content significantly increased at the baseline in DHA35 (+45%) and DHA60 groups (+85%), and at the different doses of ouabain in the DHA60 group (+73% to 98%).

Moreover, the signaling pathways involved in this synergistic effect include Src, PLC, PKCdelta, and JNK. Our results suggest that the synergism between ouabain and BDNF occurs through the activation of the Src pathway, JNK, PLC, and PKCdelta.",,,
868,Olitoriside,439501,0.988,"The present study aimed to investigate the effects of mood stabilizers, specifically lithium (Li) and valproate (VPA), on mitochondrial superoxide, lipid peroxidation, and proteins involved in cell death signaling pathways in the brains of rats subjected to the ouabain-induced animal model of mania. Wistar rats received Li, VPA, or saline twice a day for 13 days. On the 7th day of treatment, the animals received a single intracerebroventricular injection of ouabain or aCSF. After the ICV injection, the treatment with mood stabilizers continued for 6 additional days. The locomotor activity of rats was measured using the open-field test. In addition, we analyzed oxidative stress parameters, specifically levels of phosphorylated p53 (pp53), BAX and Bcl-2 in the brain of rats by immunoblot. Li and VPA reversed ouabain-related hyperactivity. Ouabain decreased Bcl-2 levels and increased the oxidative stress parameters BAX and pp53 in the brains of rats. Li and VPA improved these ouabain-induced cellular dysfunctions; however, the effects of the mood stabilizers were dependent on the protein and brain region analyzed. These findings suggest that the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase can be an important link between oxidative damage and the consequent reduction of neuronal and glial density, which are both observed in BD, and that Li and VPA exert protective effects against ouabain-induced activation of the apoptosis pathway.",,,
869,Olitoriside,439501,0.988,"Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) might prevent heart failure or optimize drug treatments by improving cardiac contraction. We investigated whether DHA-enriched avian glycerophospholipids (GPL-DHA) exert cardioprotection in ouabain-treated rats after 4 weeks of dietary supplementation with 10, 35 or 60 mg DHA per kg body weight versus none (DHA10, DHA35, DHA60 and control groups, respectively). The contractile responsiveness to different doses of ouabain (10(-7) to 10(-4) M), ouabain intoxication (at 3 X 10(-4) M), and relative variations in cardiac energy metabolism were determined using (31)P NMR in isolated perfused rat hearts. The fatty acid composition of cardiac membranes was analyzed by gas chromatography. DHA accretion in the heart was dose-dependent (+8%, +30% and +45% for DHA10, DHA35 and DHA60, respectively). The cardiac phosphocreatine content significantly increased at the baseline in DHA35 (+45%) and DHA60 groups (+85%), and at the different doses of ouabain in the DHA60 group (+73% to 98%). The maximum positive inotropy achieved at 10(-4) M ouabain was significantly increased in all DHA groups versus control (+150%, +122.5% and +135% for DHA10, DHA35 and DHA60, respectively), and ouabain intoxication was delayed. The increase in myocardial phosphocreatine content and the improved efficacy of ouabain on myocardial contraction without toxicity suggest the potential of GPL-DHA as a dietary supplement or ingredient for functional food, and possibly as a co-treatment with digitalis drugs in humans.",,,

871,Olitoriside,441207,0.991,"BACKGROUND: The cardiac glycoside digitoxin preferentially inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells and targets the Erk pathway. Digitoxin alters the expression of genes that mediate calcium metabolism and IAP genes.  PURPOSE: Since the optimal treatment for cancer involves the use of agents in combination, we assessed the growth inhibitory effects of digitoxin combined with agents that alter calcium metabolism, thapsigargin, a sarcoplasmic/ER Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor, and the statin simvastatin, as well as digitoxin's effect on the IAP pathway of apoptosis.  METHODS: To reveal signaling pathways, we treated human cancer cells with digitoxin, alone or combined with thapsigargin or simvastatin, and measured cell growth using the MTT and colony formation assays. We used histology and Western blot analysis of HEK293 cells to assay effects on IAPs.  RESULTS: Digitoxin inhibited the growth of breast, colon and ovarian cancer cells. Consistent with an effect on calcium metabolism, digitoxin exhibited synergy with thapsigargin and simvastatin on ER-negative breast cancer cells. Digitoxin activates expression of Erk pathway genes and suppresses expression of IAP genes. The growth inhibitory effects on HEK293 cells are not blocked by the pancaspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK, indicating that digitoxin may act by a caspase independent pathway of apoptosis. Furthermore, digitoxin does not have an effect on XIAP protein, a major anti-apoptotic protein.  CONCLUSION: Digitoxin appears to act through the Erk and stress response pathways and is worthwhile to study to prevent and treat cancer. Our findings warn of possible safety issues for cardiac patients who take a combination of digitoxin and statins.",,,
872,Olitoriside,441207,0.991,"The effects of concomitant drug therapy on the absorption, distribution, and elimination of digoxin and digitoxin are reviewed. A number of agents can increase or decrease the absorption of digoxin and digitoxin from the gastrointestinal tract by altering GI motility, binding the drugs through physical adsorption, altering the properties of the intestinal wall, or altering the bacterial flora of the intestine. The steady-state serum concentrations of digoxin and digitoxin can be affected if the changes in absorption are of sufficient magnitude, and adjustments in digoxin or digitoxin dosage may be required. A reduction in digoxin and digitoxin protein binding has occurred during concomitant administration of heparin and cardiac glycosides. Since digitoxin is more highly protein bound than digoxin, interactions that involve changes in protein binding are of much greater clinical importance with digitoxin. A number of drugs increase or decrease the elimination of digoxin and digitoxin, and subtherapeutic or toxic concentrations of the cardiac glycosides often result. Drugs that induce hepatic microsomal enzymes can increase the elimination of digitoxin, which is eliminated mainly by hepatic biotransformation. Digoxin is eliminated mainly by renal excretion; renal clearance of digoxin may be increased by vasodilators and thyroid hormones and decreased by quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, and potassium-sparing diuretics. The clinical importance of changes in serum concentrations of the cardiac glycosides that result from alterations in glycoside elimination requires further study, as does the importance of preliminary reports of interactions between cardiac glycosides and diazepam, captopril, and combination therapy with quinidine-pentobarbital or quinidine-rifampin. Because the cardiac glycosides have a narrow therapeutic range, patients receiving concomitant therapy with agents that might affect the absorption, distribution, or elimination of the cardiac glycosides should be monitored carefully for symptoms of digitalis toxicity or undertreatment.",,,

Junctional premature complexes may also occur. Excessive slowing of the pulse rate may be a sign of cardiac glycoside toxicity, but mild resting bradycardia in the absence of other manifestations of toxicity may not necessitate withholding the glycoside. In patients with sinus node disease (ie, sick sinus syndrome), cardiac glycosides may worsen sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block, particularly in combination with other drugs that depress sinus node or AV conduction, such a beta-adrenergic blocking agents (beta-blockers) and certain nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers. /Cardiac glycosides/",,,

1002,Malvic acid,449171,0.865,"BACKGROUND: Based on in vitro data with isolated cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes, alitretinoin interacts only with CYP3A4, and the potential for drug-drug interactions is considered negligible.  AIM: To confirm in humans the lack of potential interactions between CYP3A4 and alitretinoin in vivo.  METHODS:  This was a multiple-dose, open-label, parallel-group, single-centre study, which enrolled 54 healthy male volunteers aged 18-45 years. Subjects were divided into three groups, with 18 in each group: group 1 received either alitretinoin 30 mg and ketoconazole 200 mg, group 2 alitretinoin 30 mg and simvastatin 40 mg, and group 3 alitretinoin 30 mg and cyclosporin A 300-mg.  RESULTS: At the highest therapeutic dose of 30 mg, alitretinoin had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ketoconazole and cyclosporin A. There was a significant but not clinically relevant effect of simvastatin on the area under the curve (AUC) of plasma concentration vs. time and on maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) after repeated administration of alitretinoin. Exposure to simvastatin concomitantly with alitretinoin was decreased by 16% for AUC and 23% for C(max). The CYP3A4 +/- PgP substrates of simvastatin and cyclosporin A did not affect the single or repeated dose PK of alitretinoin. The strong CYP3A4/PgP inhibitor ketoconazole led to significant increases in both AUC and C(max) values for alitretinoin.  CONCLUSIONS: Single and repeated doses of alitretinoin do not alter the PK of cyclosporin A and ketoconazole. Simvastatin levels were slightly but significantly reduced by co-administration of alitretinoin. Substrates of CYP3A4 did not affect the PK of alitretinoin. However, ketoconazole significantly increased the plasma levels of alitretinoin, therefore, co-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole may require a dose reduction of alitretinoin.",,,

1031,Olitoriside,2724385,0.991,"The effects of concomitant drug therapy on the absorption, distribution, and elimination of digoxin and digitoxin are reviewed. A number of agents can increase or decrease the absorption of digoxin and digitoxin from the gastrointestinal tract by altering GI motility, binding the drugs through physical adsorption, altering the properties of the intestinal wall, or altering the bacterial flora of the intestine. The steady-state serum concentrations of digoxin and digitoxin can be affected if the changes in absorption are of sufficient magnitude, and adjustments in digoxin or digitoxin dosage may be required. A reduction in digoxin and digitoxin protein binding has occurred during concomitant administration of heparin and cardiac glycosides. Since digitoxin is more highly protein bound than digoxin, interactions that involve changes in protein binding are of much greater clinical importance with digitoxin. A number of drugs increase or decrease the elimination of digoxin and digitoxin, and subtherapeutic or toxic concentrations of the cardiac glycosides often result. Drugs that induce hepatic microsomal enzymes can increase the elimination of digitoxin, which is eliminated mainly by hepatic biotransformation. Digoxin is eliminated mainly by renal excretion; renal clearance of digoxin may be increased by vasodilators and thyroid hormones and decreased by quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, and potassium-sparing diuretics. The clinical importance of changes in serum concentrations of the cardiac glycosides that result from alterations in glycoside elimination requires further study, as does the importance of preliminary reports of interactions between cardiac glycosides and diazepam, captopril, and combination therapy with quinidine-pentobarbital or quinidine-rifampin.

1410,Psi-Baptigenin,5280863,0.664,"It has been reported that tamoxifen is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, and kaempferol is an inhibitor of P-gp and CYP3A. Hence, it could be expected that kaempferol would affect the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen. Thus, tamoxifen was administered orally (10 mg/kg) without or with oral kaempferol (2.5 and 10 mg/kg). In the presence of kaempferol, the total area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time infinity (AUC) of tamoxifen was significantly greater, C(max) was significantly higher and F was considerably greater than those without kaempferol. The enhanced bioavailability of oral tamoxifen by oral kaempferol could have been due to an inhibition of CYP3A and P-gp by kaempferol. The presence of kaempferol did not alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of a metabolite of tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen.

1411,Psi-Baptigenin,5280863,0.664,"This study was to investigate the effect of kaempferol on the pharmacokinetics of etoposide after oral or intravenous administration of etoposide in rats. The oral (6 mg/kg) or intravenous (2 mg/kg) etoposide was administered to rats alone or 30 min after the oral kaempferol (1, 4, or 12 mg/kg) administration. Compared to the oral control group, the presence of kaempferol significantly (4 mg/kg, P < 0.05; 12 mg/kg, P < 0.01) increased the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) and the peak concentration (C(max)) of the oral etoposide. Kaempferol decreased significantly (4 or 12 mg/kg, P < 0.05) the total body clearance (CL/F) of oral etoposide, while there was no significant change in the terminal halflife (t(1/2)), the elimination rate constant (K(el)) and the time to reach the peak concentration (T(max)) of etoposide in the presense of kaempferol. Consequently, the absolute bioavailability (AB%) of oral etoposide with kaempferol was significantly higher (4 mg/kg, P < 0.05; 12 mg/kg, P < 0.01) than those from the control group. Compared to the intravenous control group, the presence of kaempferol enhanced the AUC of intravenously administered etoposide, however, only presence of 12 mg/kg of kaempferol significant (P < 0.05) increased AUC of etoposide. The enhanced bioavailability of oral etoposide by kaempferol could have been due to an inhibition of cytochrom P450 (CYP) 3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the intestinal or decreased total body clearance in the liver by kaempferol.

While the in vitro assays supported the estrogenic effects of genistein and methoxychlor and the antiandrogenic effects of methoxychlor, the reactivity of these compounds with ERs alpha and beta could not predict the greater in vivo estrogenic potency of methoxychlor over genistein; nor could the potentiation of the methoxychlor effect on PPS by genistein be predicted based on in vitro HPTE and genistein reactions with the AR. Data from this study indicate that phytoestrogens are capable of altering the toxicological behaviors of other EACs, and the interactions of these compounds may involve complexities that are difficult to predict based on their in vitro steroid receptor reactivities.

The activation of activator protein-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB induced by UVB was dose-dependently inhibited by myricetin treatment. Western blot and kinase assay data revealed that myricetin inhibited Fyn kinase activity and subsequently attenuated UVB-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Pull-down assays revealed that myricetin competitively bound with ATP to suppress Fyn kinase activity. Importantly, myricetin exerted similar inhibitory effects compared with 4-amino-5-(4-chloro-phenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, a well-known pharmacologic inhibitor of Fyn. In vivo mouse skin data also revealed that myricetin inhibited Fyn kinase activity directly and subsequently attenuated UVB-induced COX-2 expression. Mouse skin tumorigenesis data clearly showed that pretreatment with myricetin significantly suppressed UVB-induced skin tumor incidence in a dose-dependent manner. Docking data suggest that myricetin is easily docked to the ATP-binding site of Fyn, which is located between the N and C lobes of the kinase domain.

The activation of activator protein-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB induced by UVB was dose-dependently inhibited by myricetin treatment. Western blot and kinase assay data revealed that myricetin inhibited Fyn kinase activity and subsequently attenuated UVB-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Pull-down assays revealed that myricetin competitively bound with ATP to suppress Fyn kinase activity. Importantly, myricetin exerted similar inhibitory effects compared with 4-amino-5-(4-chloro-phenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, a well-known pharmacologic inhibitor of Fyn. In vivo mouse skin data also revealed that myricetin inhibited Fyn kinase activity directly and subsequently attenuated UVB-induced COX-2 expression. Mouse skin tumorigenesis data clearly showed that pretreatment with myricetin significantly suppressed UVB-induced skin tumor incidence in a dose-dependent manner. Docking data suggest that myricetin is easily docked to the ATP-binding site of Fyn, which is located between the N and C lobes of the kinase domain.

Rats fed with fructose diet (60 g/100 g) for 60 days exhibited metabolic abnormalities and rise in plasma and cardiac lipids and whole body IR. The levels of cardiac antioxidants and plasma ferric reducing antioxidant power were significantly reduced in FFR concomitant with increased levels of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation products. A significant rise in troponin T, creatine kinase-MB, aspartate transaminase, and lactate dehydrogenase in plasma of FFR was noted. RA supplementation to FFR (10 mg/kg from the 16th day) significantly improved insulin sensitivity, reduced lipid levels, oxidative damage, and the expression of p22phox subunit of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced oxidase, and prevented cardiac hypertrophy. Fructose-induced rise in blood pressure was also lowered by RA through decrease in endothelin-1 and angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and increase in nitric oxide levels.

The toxicity is due to oleandrin and the deglycosylated metabolite oleandrigenin. Bufalin and cinobufotalin (toad cardiac toxins) are also widely used in Chinese medicines like Chan SU, and Lu-Shen -WU. Severe toxicity from bufalin after consumption of toad soup has been reported. Taking advantage of structural similarities of these toxins with digitoxin, we demonstrated that these compounds can be rapidly detected in blood by the fluorescence polarization immunoassay for digitoxin. The cross reactivities of these compounds with digoxin assay were much lower. For example, when a drug free serum was supplemented with 10 ug/mL of oleandrin, we observed 127.7 ng/mL of digitoxin equivalent but only 2.4 ng/mL of digoxin equivalent concentration. Digibind neutralized all cardiac toxins studied as evidenced by significant fall of free concentrations. When aliquots of serum pool containing 50.0 ug/mL of oleandrin were supplemented with 0, 10.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100, and 200 ug/mL of digibind, the mean free concentrations were 30.6, 23.3, 16.0, 10.7, 7.8 and 5.5 ug/mL respectively. Similarly, with 50.0 ug/mL of oleandrigenin (total concentration: 36.2 ng/mL), the free concentration was 14.5 ng/mL digitoxin equivalent in the absence of digibind and 5.4 ng/mL in the presence of 200 microg/mL of digibind. In another specimen containing 500 ng/mL bufalin (total concentration: 156.9 ng/mL), the free concentration was 8.6 ng/mL in the absence of digibind and none detected in the presence of 100.0 ug/mL digibind.

In this report we provide evidences that oleandrin, a cardiac glycoside potentially inhibited IL-8-, formyl peptide (FMLP)-, EGF-, or nerve growth factor (NGF)-, but not IL-1- or TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation in macrophages. Oleandrin inhibited IL-8-, but not TNF-induced NF-kappaB-dependent genes expression. Oleandrin inhibited the binding of IL-8, EGF, or NGF, but not IL-1 or TNF. It decreased almost 79% IL-8 binding without altering affinity towards IL-8 receptors and this inhibition of IL-8 binding was observed in isolated membrane. The IL-8, anti-IL-8Rs antibodies, or protease inhibitors were unable to protect oleandrin-mediated inhibition of IL-8 binding. Phospholipids significantly protected oleandrin-mediated inhibition of IL-8 binding thereby restoring IL-8-induced NF-kappaB activation. Oleandrin altered the membrane fluidity as detected by microviscosity parameter and a decrease in diphenylhexatriene, a lipid binding fluorophore binding in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, our results suggest that oleandrin inhibits IL-8-mediated biological responses in diverse cell types by modulating IL-8Rs through altering membrane fluidity and microviscosity. The study might help to regulate IL-8-mediated biological responses involved in inflammation, metastasis, and neovascularization.",,,

In the present study we explored the relative radiosensitization potential of oleandrin, a cardiac glycoside contained within the plant extract known as Anvirzel that recently underwent a Phase I trial as a novel drug for anticancer therapy. The data show that oleandrin produces an enhancement of sensitivity of PC-3 human prostate cells to radiation; at a cell survival of 0.1, the enhancement factor was 1.32. The magnitude of radiosensitization depended on duration of exposure of cells to drug prior to radiation treatment. While a radiosensitizing effect of oleandrin was evident with only 1 hr of cell exposure to drug, the effect greatly increased with 24 hr oleandrin pretreatment. Susceptibility of PC-3 cells to oleandrin and radiation-induced apoptosis was dependent on activation of caspase-3.

For example, when a drug free serum was supplemented with 10 ug/mL of oleandrin, we observed 127.7 ng/mL of digitoxin equivalent but only 2.4 ng/mL of digoxin equivalent concentration. Digibind neutralized all cardiac toxins studied as evidenced by significant fall of free concentrations.

In another specimen containing 500 ng/mL bufalin (total concentration: 156.9 ng/mL), the free concentration was 8.6 ng/mL in the absence of digibind and none detected in the presence of 100.0 ug/mL digibind.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the potential of the phytoestrogen genistein to influence the reproductive developmental toxicity of the endocrine-active pesticide methoxychlor. Three levels of genistein (0, 300, or 800 ppm) and two levels of methoxychlor (0 or 800 ppm) were used in this study. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to the two compounds, either alone or in combinations, through dietary administration to dams during pregnancy and lactation and to the offspring directly after weaning. Both compounds, methoxychlor in particular, were associated with reduced body growth at 800 ppm, but pregnancy outcome was not affected by either treatment. An acceleration of vaginal opening (VO) in the exposed female offspring was the only observed effect of genistein at 300 ppm. Exposure to 800 ppm genistein or 800 ppm methoxychlor caused accelerated VO and also altered estrous cyclicity toward persistent estrus in the female offspring. The estrogenic responses to genistein and methoxychlor administered together were apparently accumulative of the effects associated with each compound alone. Methoxychlor, but not genistein, delayed preputial separation (PPS) in the male rats. When administered with methoxychlor, genistein at 800 ppm enhanced the effect of methoxychlor on delaying PPS. Genistein and methoxychlor treatment did not change gender-specific motor activity patterns in either sex. To explore possible mechanisms for interaction between the two compounds on development, we performed estrogen receptor (ER)- and androgen receptor (AR)-based in vitro transcriptional activation assays using genistein and the primary methoxychlor metabolite 2,2-bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (HPTE).

Data from this study indicate that phytoestrogens are capable of altering the toxicological behaviors of other EACs, and the interactions of these compounds may involve complexities that are difficult to predict based on their in vitro steroid receptor reactivities.

Interactions between the soy isoflavone, genistein, and an antiestrogen, tamoxifen (TAM), on the growth of estrogen (E)-dependent breast cancer (MCF-7) cells implanted in ovariectomized athymic mice /were investigated/. ... Six treatment groups were used: control (C); 0.25 mg estradiol (E2) implant (E); E2 implant + 2.5 mg TAM implant (2.5 TE); E2 implant + 2.5 mg TAM implant + 1000 ppm genistein (2.5 TEG); E2 implant + 5 mg TAM implant (5 TE), and E2 implant +5 mg TAM implant +1000 ppm genistein (5 TEG). Treatment with TAM (2.5 TE and 5 TE) suppressed E2-stimulated MCF-7 tumor growth in ovariectomized athymic mice. Dietary genistein negated/overwhelmed the inhibitory effect of TAM on MCF-7 tumor growth, lowered E2 level in plasma, and increased expression of E-responsive genes (e.g., pS2, PR, and cyclin D1). ...

It was found that the inhibitory rate in cells with combined treatment was significantly higher than that of the cells treated with IR or genistein alone. After treatments of IR (4 Gy) combined with genistein (40 micromol/L), the apoptotic index of the cells was significantly increased and the cells were arrested in the G2/M phase. Survivin mRNA expression increased after IR (4 Gy), while it significantly decreased after combined treatment. These findings indicated that genistein enhanced the radiosensitivity of cervical cancer HeLa cells, and the mechanisms for this action might include increase of apoptosis, decrease of survivin expression, and prolongation of cell cycle arrest.",,,

Drug-interaction experiments, supplemented by dose-response data, examined the effects of these compounds on locomotor activity, on striatal levels of dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and on levels of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated (Arc) gene expression in the striatum and frontal cortex of male Sprague-Dawley rats. Haloperidol, a classical dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, was also tested for comparison. Monitoring for 1 hour after co-administration of tetrabenazine 0.64 mg/kg and pridopidine 32 mg/kg revealed a reduction in locomotor activity, measured as distance travelled, in the tetrabenazine treated group, down to 61% vs. vehicle controls (p < 0.001). This was significantly alleviated by pridopidine (distance travelled reached 137% vs. tetrabenazine controls, p < 0.01). In contrast, co-administration of haloperidol 0.12 mg/kg and tetrabenazine produced increased inhibition of locomotor activity over the same period (p < 0.01, 41% vs. tetrabenazine). Co-administration of pridopidine, 10.5 mg/kg or 32 mg/kg, with tetrabenazine counteracted significantly (p < 0.05) and dose-dependently the decrease in frontal cortex Arc levels induced by tetrabenazine 0.64 mg/kg (Arc mRNA reached 193% vs. tetrabenazine mean at 32 mg/kg); this counteraction was not seen with haloperidol. Tetrabenazine retained its characteristic neurochemical effects of increased striatal DOPAC and reduced striatal dopamine when co-administered with pridopidine.

The results showed a significant reduction in the frequency of ACF in the group treated with the triterpenoid compounds plus DMH when compared to those treated with DMH alone, suggesting that UA and OA suppress the formation of ACF and have a protective effect against colon carcinogenesis.",,,
1721,Cryptogenin,64945,0.935,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the chloroform extract of Terminalia catappa L. leaves (TCCE) on carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced acute liver damage and D-galactosamine (D-GalN)-induced hepatocyte injury. Moreover, the effects of ursolic acid and asiatic acid, two isolated components of TCCE, on mitochondria and free radicals were investigated to determine the mechanism underlying the action of TCCE on hepatotoxicity. In the acute hepatic damage test, remarkable rises in the activity of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (5.7- and 2.0-fold) induced by CCl(4) were reversed and significant morphological changes were lessened with pre-treatment with 50 and 100 mg/kg TCCE. In the hepatocyte injury experiment, the increases in ALT and AST levels (1.9- and 2.1-fold) in the medium of primary cultured hepatocytes induced by D-GalN were blocked by pre-treatment with 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 g/L TCCE. In addition, Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial swelling was dose-dependently inhibited by 50-500 uM ursolic acid and asiatic acid. Both ursolic acid and asiatic acid, at concentrations ranging from 50 to 500 uM, showed dose-dependent superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. It can be concluded that TCCE has hepatoprotective activity and the mechanism is related to protection of liver mitochondria and the scavenging action on free radicals.",,,

The cytotoxic effect of this compound and its augmentative effect on the anticancer drug irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11) were investigated in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29. Asiatic acid dose-dependently showed cytotoxicity in HT-29 cells. DNA fragmentation, annexin-positive apoptotic cells, and caspase-3 activation were observed in a dose-dependent manner. A caspase-3 inhibitor suppressed the DNA ladder formation in a concentration-dependent manner. Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins were decreased by asiatic acid treatment. These results indicate that asiatic acid induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells via caspase-3 activation. Cytotoxic effects of combined treatment with CPT-11 and asiatic acid on HT-29 cells were further examined. Simultaneous treatment or sequential exposure first to asiatic acid and then to CPT-11 showed an additive effect. Synergism was observed when cells were first exposed to CPT-11 and then to asiatic acid. These results suggest that asiatic acid can be used as an agent for increasing sensitivity of colon cancer cells to treatment with CPT-11 or as an agent for reducing adverse effects of CPT-11.",,,
1724,Cryptogenin,119034,0.91,"Asiatic acid, a pentacyclic triterpene, has been reported to induce apoptosis of various human cancer cells. In the present study, we assessed the anti-tumor promoting effect of asiatic acid against 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA)-mediated skin tumorigenesis in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated ICR mice. Topical application of asiatic acid prior to each application of TPA resulted in a significant reduction in skin tumor formation. We also found that pre-application of asiatic acid alleviated TPA-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation, which is a conventional marker for skin tumor promotion. In addition, asiatic acid inhibited the TPA-induced generation of nitric oxide (NO) and expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which are known to play important roles in tumor growth, especially in the promotion stage. In addition, topical application of aminoguanidine (AG), a selective iNOS inhibitor, and N(G)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (NAME), another iNOS inhibitor, 30 min prior to TPA treatment significantly inhibited the TPA-induced COX-2 expression. These results suggest that asiatic acid may exert anti-tumorigenesis through inhibitory actions in NO and COX-2 signals.",,,

We evaluated the activities of these two compounds on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms grown in rotating disk reactors (RDRs) in combination with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin. To determine the ruggedness of our systems, the antibiotic susceptibilities of these biofilms were assessed with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin. The biofilm bacteria produced in the RDR were shown to display remarkable tolerance to 10 mug/ml of ciprofloxacin, thus mimicking the tolerance observed in recalcitrant bacterial infections. These studies further demonstrate that a nonmucoid strain of P. aeruginosa can form a biofilm that tolerates ciprofloxacin at clinically relevant concentrations. Neither asiatic acid nor corosolic acid reduced the viable cell density of P. aeruginosa biofilms. However, both compounds increased the susceptibility of biofilm bacteria to subsequent treatment with tobramycin, suggesting asiatic acid and corosolic acid to be compounds that potentiate the activity of antibiotics. A similar statistical interaction was observed between ciprofloxacin and subsequent treatment with tobramycin.",,,

Protective effects of asiatic acid (AA) and beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) were evaluated on hepatocytes injured by D-GalN (2 mmol/L) or CCl4 (10 mmol/L). Cell morphology was observed by light microscope, cell viability was measured by MTT assay, AST and LDH were determined by an automatic analyzer. Fluorescence assay was applied to test reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide end products (NOx) and reduced glutathione (GSH), and JC-1 staining was used to determine mitochondria membrane potential (DeltaPsim). AST and LDH in medium were decreased when treated with AA and GA after D-GalN injury (P<0.05), furthermore AA enhanced the hepatocyte viability (P<0.05). Moreover, AA and GA significantly reduced ROS and NOx generation, and ameliorated DeltaPsim lost induced by D-GalN. AA also inhibited GSH decrease due to D-GalN and CCl4 treatment. Both AA and GA could protect hepatocytes from D-GalN and CCl4 injuries, which is associated with reducing intracellular ROS and NOx, reversing GSH depression and ameliorating DeltaPsim lost.",,,

Abdominal rat skin mounted in Franz cells was used for in vitro experiments. To evaluate CyD interaction with a bilayer structure model, dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and DPPC-Chol (8:2 mole ratio) vesicles were used. CyD vesicle interaction was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry. Permeation through rat skin and calorimetric experiments demonstrated that at low concentrations DM-beta-CyD shows higher enhancer activity as a possible result of a perturbing action on the skin by a complexation of its lipid components, but at higher concentrations HP-beta-CyD is the most effective. By considering that HP-beta-CyD presents a very moderate destabilizing action on the skin, /it was concluded/ that a 10% aqueous solution of this macrocycle appears to be the most suitable transdermal absorption enhancer for PAP.",,,

The activation of activator protein-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB induced by UVB was dose-dependently inhibited by myricetin treatment. Western blot and kinase assay data revealed that myricetin inhibited Fyn kinase activity and subsequently attenuated UVB-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Pull-down assays revealed that myricetin competitively bound with ATP to suppress Fyn kinase activity. Importantly, myricetin exerted similar inhibitory effects compared with 4-amino-5-(4-chloro-phenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, a well-known pharmacologic inhibitor of Fyn. In vivo mouse skin data also revealed that myricetin inhibited Fyn kinase activity directly and subsequently attenuated UVB-induced COX-2 expression. Mouse skin tumorigenesis data clearly showed that pretreatment with myricetin significantly suppressed UVB-induced skin tumor incidence in a dose-dependent manner. Docking data suggest that myricetin is easily docked to the ATP-binding site of Fyn, which is located between the N and C lobes of the kinase domain.

We are reporting the first deaths (a 30-year-old man and a 28-year-old woman), after ingesting rachacha balls and alcohol consumption during an evening with a friend. Signs compatible with acute anoxia were observed during autopsy. Toxicological analyses highlighted the presence of morphine and codeine in the blood, urine and bile, with an absence of 6-acetylmorphine. Concomitant consumption of alcohol certainly played a role in the occurrence of death. The black paste found at the scene was identified as rachacha. The mean of consumption (orally) was confirmed by the presence of morphine and codeine in the gastric contents of both victims. The analysis of hair samples was performed to reveal the substance consumption history. Therefore, a possibility of contamination by sweat and/or putrefactive liquids in the post-mortem period must be considered for the interpretation of the results.

We examined whether the combination of opioids (tramadol and morphine) with indomethacin or acetaminophen produce favorable effects on neuropathic pain and compared the efficacy for neuropathic pain with that for inflammatory pain. The carrageenan model was used as the inflammatory pain model while the tibial neuroma transposition (TNT) model was used as the neuropathic pain model. The tibial nerve is transected in the TNT model, with the tibial nerve stump then transpositioned to the lateral aspect of the hindlimb. Neuropathic pain (mechanical allodynia and neuroma pain) is observed after TNT injury. Drugs were administered orally. In the carrageenan model, all drugs produced anti-allodynic effects and all drug combinations, but not tramadol + indomethacin combination, produced synergistic anti-allodynic effects. In the TNT model, tramadol and morphine, but not acetaminophen and indomethacin, produced anti-neuropathic pain effects. In the combination, with the exception of morphine + acetaminophen combination, both acetaminophen and indomethacin reduced the 50% effective dose (ED50) of tramadol and morphine as compared with the ED50s for the single drug study in the TNT model. The ED50s of tramadol and morphine in the carrageenan combination test were not statistically significantly different from the ED50s in the TNT model combination study. The combination of opioids with indomethacin or acetaminophen produced a synergistic analgesic effect both in inflammatory and neuropathic pain with some exceptions.

Hence, the current study aimed to assess the role of TLR2, TLR4, MyD88 (as a critical TLR-signaling participant), NF-kappaB, Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta; as a downstream proinflammatory effector molecule) and the mu opioid receptor (MOR; as a classical site for morphine action) in acute alcohol-induced sedation (4.5 g/kg) and alcohol (2.5 g/kg) interaction with morphine (5 mg/kg) by assessing the loss of righting reflex (LORR) as a measure of sedation. Wild-type male Balb/c mice and matched genetically-deficient TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88 strains were utilized, together with pharmacological manipulation of MOR, NF-kappaB, TLR4 and Interleukin-1beta. Alcohol induced significant LORR in wild-type mice; this was halved by MyD88 and TLR4 deficiency, and surprisingly nearly completely eliminated by TLR2 deficiency. In contrast, the interaction between morphine and alcohol was found to be MOR-, NF-kappaB-, TLR2- and MyD88-dependent, but did not involve TLR4 or Interleukin-1beta. Morphine-alcohol interactions caused acute elevations in microglial cell counts and NF-kappaB-p65 positive cells in the motor cortex in concordance with wild-type and TLR2 deficient mouse behavioral data, implicating neuroimmunopharmacological signaling as a pivotal mechanism in this clinically problematic drug-drug interaction.",,,

We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of naltrexone co-administered with cocaine and the association of these substances with immediate-early gene expression in the rat prefrontal cortex. We used chronic operant ethanol self-administration and oral treatments prescribed for alcoholism and available in pharmacies to maximize the predictive validity in humans. We performed real-time PCR analysis to determine gene expression levels in the prefrontal cortex. Only the highest dose of naltrexone (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced the response to ethanol. Cocaine increased ethanol self-administration in a dose-dependent manner (2.5, 10, 20 mg/kg, i.p.) and reversed the naltrexone-induced reduction. Naltrexone failed to prevent the cocaine-induced increase in locomotor activity observed in these animals. Chronic self-administration of ethanol reduced the expression of the C-fos gene 4- to 12-fold and increased expression of the COX-2 (up to 4-fold) and Homer1a genes in the rat prefrontal cortex. Chronic ethanol self-administration is prevented by naltrexone, but cocaine fully reverses this effect. This result suggests that cocaine may overcome naltrexone's effectiveness as a treatment for alcoholism.

This study aimed to assess the behavioral specificity of anorectic responses to bupropion, naltrexone and their combination. Video analysis was employed to characterize the behavioral effects of acute systemic treatment with bupropion (10.0-40.0 mg/kg), naltrexone (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) and combined bupropion (20 mg/kg) plus naltrexone (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) in non-deprived male rats exposed for 1 hr to palatable mash. Particular attention was paid to the behavioral satiety sequence (BSS). In experiment 1, the anorectic response to 40 mg/kg bupropion was associated with significant psychomotor stimulation and a complete disruption of the BSS. In experiment 2, the anorectic response to 3 mg/kg naltrexone was associated with an accelerated but otherwise normal BSS. In experiment 3, the co-administration of 20 mg/kg bupropion and naltrexone (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) not only produced an additive anorectic profile (including a reduced rate of eating), but the addition of the opioid receptor antagonist also concurrently attenuated the psychomotor stimulant response to the atypical antidepressant.

Combining naltrexone and alprazolam might safely maximize efficacy while avoiding the untoward effects of the constituent compounds. The present pilot study tested the hypothesis that acute pretreatment with the combination of naltrexone and alprazolam would not produce clinically problematic physiological effects or negative subjective effects and would reduce the positive subjective effects of d-amphetamine to a greater extent than the constituent drugs alone. Eight nontreatment-seeking, stimulant-using individuals completed an outpatient experiment in which oral d-amphetamine (0, 15, and 30 mg) was administered following acute pretreatment with naltrexone (0 and 50 mg) and alprazolam (0 and 0.5 mg). Subjective effects, psychomotor task performance, and physiological measures were collected. Oral d-amphetamine produced prototypical physiological and stimulant-like positive subjective effects (e.g., VAS ratings of Active/Alert/Energetic, Good Effect, and High). Pretreatment with naltrexone, alprazolam, and their combination did not produce clinically problematic acute physiological effects or negative subjective effects. Naltrexone and alprazolam each significantly attenuated some of the subjective effects of d-amphetamine.

Bombesin significantly increased the incidence of intestinal tumors and cancer metastasis to the peritoneum in week 45. It also significantly increased the labeling index of intestinal cancers. Although administration of apigenin at either dose with bombesin had little or no effect on the enhancement of intestinal carcinogenesis by bombesin, the location, histologic type, depth of involvement, infiltrating growth patterns and labeling index, it was found to decrease significantly the incidence of cancer metastasis. Apigenin significantly decreased the incidence of lymphatic vessel invasion of adenocarcinomas, which was enhanced by bombesin. In vitro experiments revealed that apigenin inhibited bombesin-enhanced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-9 expression.",,,

Hence, it could be expected that kaempferol would affect the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen. Thus, tamoxifen was administered orally (10 mg/kg) without or with oral kaempferol (2.5 and 10 mg/kg). In the presence of kaempferol, the total area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time infinity (AUC) of tamoxifen was significantly greater, C(max) was significantly higher and F was considerably greater than those without kaempferol. The enhanced bioavailability of oral tamoxifen by oral kaempferol could have been due to an inhibition of CYP3A and P-gp by kaempferol. The presence of kaempferol did not alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of a metabolite of tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen.

Compared to the oral control group, the presence of kaempferol significantly (4 mg/kg, P < 0.05; 12 mg/kg, P < 0.01) increased the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) and the peak concentration (C(max)) of the oral etoposide. Kaempferol decreased significantly (4 or 12 mg/kg, P < 0.05) the total body clearance (CL/F) of oral etoposide, while there was no significant change in the terminal halflife (t(1/2)), the elimination rate constant (K(el)) and the time to reach the peak concentration (T(max)) of etoposide in the presense of kaempferol. Consequently, the absolute bioavailability (AB%) of oral etoposide with kaempferol was significantly higher (4 mg/kg, P < 0.05; 12 mg/kg, P < 0.01) than those from the control group. Compared to the intravenous control group, the presence of kaempferol enhanced the AUC of intravenously administered etoposide, however, only presence of 12 mg/kg of kaempferol significant (P < 0.05) increased AUC of etoposide. The enhanced bioavailability of oral etoposide by kaempferol could have been due to an inhibition of cytochrom P450 (CYP) 3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the intestinal or decreased total body clearance in the liver by kaempferol.

The activation of activator protein-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB induced by UVB was dose-dependently inhibited by myricetin treatment. Western blot and kinase assay data revealed that myricetin inhibited Fyn kinase activity and subsequently attenuated UVB-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Pull-down assays revealed that myricetin competitively bound with ATP to suppress Fyn kinase activity. Importantly, myricetin exerted similar inhibitory effects compared with 4-amino-5-(4-chloro-phenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, a well-known pharmacologic inhibitor of Fyn. In vivo mouse skin data also revealed that myricetin inhibited Fyn kinase activity directly and subsequently attenuated UVB-induced COX-2 expression. Mouse skin tumorigenesis data clearly showed that pretreatment with myricetin significantly suppressed UVB-induced skin tumor incidence in a dose-dependent manner. Docking data suggest that myricetin is easily docked to the ATP-binding site of Fyn, which is located between the N and C lobes of the kinase domain.

Topical application of asiatic acid prior to each application of TPA resulted in a significant reduction in skin tumor formation. We also found that pre-application of asiatic acid alleviated TPA-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation, which is a conventional marker for skin tumor promotion. In addition, asiatic acid inhibited the TPA-induced generation of nitric oxide (NO) and expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which are known to play important roles in tumor growth, especially in the promotion stage. In addition, topical application of aminoguanidine (AG), a selective iNOS inhibitor, and N(G)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (NAME), another iNOS inhibitor, 30 min prior to TPA treatment significantly inhibited the TPA-induced COX-2 expression.

Haloperidol, a classical dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, was also tested for comparison. Monitoring for 1 hour after co-administration of tetrabenazine 0.64 mg/kg and pridopidine 32 mg/kg revealed a reduction in locomotor activity, measured as distance travelled, in the tetrabenazine treated group, down to 61% vs. vehicle controls (p < 0.001). This was significantly alleviated by pridopidine (distance travelled reached 137% vs. tetrabenazine controls, p < 0.01).

1847,quercetin,5280961,0.863,"Humans and wildlife are frequently exposed to mixtures of endocrine active-compounds (EAC). The objective of the present study was to investigate the potential of the phytoestrogen genistein to influence the reproductive developmental toxicity of the endocrine-active pesticide methoxychlor. Three levels of genistein (0, 300, or 800 ppm) and two levels of methoxychlor (0 or 800 ppm) were used in this study. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to the two compounds, either alone or in combinations, through dietary administration to dams during pregnancy and lactation and to the offspring directly after weaning. Both compounds, methoxychlor in particular, were associated with reduced body growth at 800 ppm, but pregnancy outcome was not affected by either treatment. An acceleration of vaginal opening (VO) in the exposed female offspring was the only observed effect of genistein at 300 ppm. Exposure to 800 ppm genistein or 800 ppm methoxychlor caused accelerated VO and also altered estrous cyclicity toward persistent estrus in the female offspring. The estrogenic responses to genistein and methoxychlor administered together were apparently accumulative of the effects associated with each compound alone. Methoxychlor, but not genistein, delayed preputial separation (PPS) in the male rats. When administered with methoxychlor, genistein at 800 ppm enhanced the effect of methoxychlor on delaying PPS. Genistein and methoxychlor treatment did not change gender-specific motor activity patterns in either sex. To explore possible mechanisms for interaction between the two compounds on development, we performed estrogen receptor (ER)- and androgen receptor (AR)-based in vitro transcriptional activation assays using genistein and the primary methoxychlor metabolite 2,2-bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (HPTE). While the in vitro assays supported the estrogenic effects of genistein and methoxychlor and the antiandrogenic effects of methoxychlor, the reactivity of these compounds with ERs alpha and beta could not predict the greater in vivo estrogenic potency of methoxychlor over genistein; nor could the potentiation of the methoxychlor effect on PPS by genistein be predicted based on in vitro HPTE and genistein reactions with the AR. Data from this study indicate that phytoestrogens are capable of altering the toxicological behaviors of other EACs, and the interactions of these compounds may involve complexities that are difficult to predict based on their in vitro steroid receptor reactivities.

1901,bisdehydroneotuberostemonine,4595,0.729,"The nephrotoxicity limits the clinical application of cisplatin. Human organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATEs) work in concert in the elimination of cationic drugs such as cisplatin from the kidney. We hypothesized that co-administration of ondansetron would have an effect on cisplatin nephrotoxicity by altering the function of cisplatin transporters. The inhibitory potencies of ondansetron on metformin accumulation mediated by OCT2 and MATEs were determined in the stable HEK-293 cells expressing these transporters. The effects of ondansetron on drug disposition in vivo were examined by conducting the pharmacokinetics of metformin, a classical substrate for OCTs and MATEs, in wild-type and Mate1-/- mice. The nephrotoxicity was assessed in the wild-type and Mate1-/- mice received cisplatin with and without ondansetron. Both MATEs, including human MATE1, human MATE2-K, and mouse Mate1, and OCT2 (human and mouse) were subject to ondansetron inhibition, with much greater potencies by ondansetron on MATEs. Ondansetron significantly increased tissue accumulation and pharmacokinetic exposure of metformin in wild-type but not in Mate1-/- mice. Moreover, ondansetron treatment significantly enhanced renal accumulation of cisplatin and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity which were indicated by increased levels of biochemical and molecular biomarkers and more severe pathohistological changes in mice. Similar increases in nephrotoxicity were caused by genetic deficiency of MATE function in mice. Therefore, the potent inhibition of MATEs by ondansetron enhances the nephrotoxicity associated with cisplatin treatment in mice. Potential nephrotoxic effects of combining the chemotherapeutic cisplatin and the antiemetic 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron, should be investigated in patients.",,,

1922,Sexangularetin,5280961,0.694,"Humans and wildlife are frequently exposed to mixtures of endocrine active-compounds (EAC). The objective of the present study was to investigate the potential of the phytoestrogen genistein to influence the reproductive developmental toxicity of the endocrine-active pesticide methoxychlor. Three levels of genistein (0, 300, or 800 ppm) and two levels of methoxychlor (0 or 800 ppm) were used in this study. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to the two compounds, either alone or in combinations, through dietary administration to dams during pregnancy and lactation and to the offspring directly after weaning. Both compounds, methoxychlor in particular, were associated with reduced body growth at 800 ppm, but pregnancy outcome was not affected by either treatment. An acceleration of vaginal opening (VO) in the exposed female offspring was the only observed effect of genistein at 300 ppm. Exposure to 800 ppm genistein or 800 ppm methoxychlor caused accelerated VO and also altered estrous cyclicity toward persistent estrus in the female offspring. The estrogenic responses to genistein and methoxychlor administered together were apparently accumulative of the effects associated with each compound alone. Methoxychlor, but not genistein, delayed preputial separation (PPS) in the male rats. When administered with methoxychlor, genistein at 800 ppm enhanced the effect of methoxychlor on delaying PPS. Genistein and methoxychlor treatment did not change gender-specific motor activity patterns in either sex. To explore possible mechanisms for interaction between the two compounds on development, we performed estrogen receptor (ER)- and androgen receptor (AR)-based in vitro transcriptional activation assays using genistein and the primary methoxychlor metabolite 2,2-bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (HPTE). While the in vitro assays supported the estrogenic effects of genistein and methoxychlor and the antiandrogenic effects of methoxychlor, the reactivity of these compounds with ERs alpha and beta could not predict the greater in vivo estrogenic potency of methoxychlor over genistein; nor could the potentiation of the methoxychlor effect on PPS by genistein be predicted based on in vitro HPTE and genistein reactions with the AR. Data from this study indicate that phytoestrogens are capable of altering the toxicological behaviors of other EACs, and the interactions of these compounds may involve complexities that are difficult to predict based on their in vitro steroid receptor reactivities.

1929,sessilifoline B,4158,0.648,"Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopment disorder occurring during childhood. However, ADHD persists into adulthood in 45.7% of cases. The global prevalence of adult ADHD is estimated to 5.3%, with no difference between Europe and North America. ADHD is often comorbid with substance use disorder (SUD), with Odds Ratio ranges from 1.5 to 7.9, depending on the substance and the dependence level. Conversely, the prevalence of ADHD among patients with SUD is 10.8%, versus 3.8% for patients without SUD. Methylphenidate (MPH) alleviates ADHD symptoms and, as such, is currently considered as a first choice medication. MPH blocks the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters leading to an increase in extracellular dopamine. It should be noted that its subjective effects are highly dependent on the pharmacokinetic and especially on the rate of input, which highlights the importance of choosing a sustained-release formulation. Meanwhile, prescribing MPH to patients with comorbid SUD has always been challenging for clinicians. The aim of this review is to address the benefits and pitfalls of using MPH in adults with ADHD comorbid SUD, depending on each of the following types of SUD: amphetamine, cocaine, nicotine, alcohol, cannabis and opiates. Overall, due to the prevalence of ADHD in SUD and to the benefits of MPH observed in this population, and considering the mild or low side effects observed, the response to MPH treatment should be evaluated individually in adults with comorbid ADHD and SUD. The choice of the formulation should favor sustained- release MPH over immediate release MPH. Cardiovascular parameters also have to be monitored during long-term use.",,,
